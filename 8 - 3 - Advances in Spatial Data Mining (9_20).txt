Welcome back to the discussion
of spatial computing.
In this video, I would like to describe a
current research project in our own group.
If you saw the other video on research
project, you already know, you know,
our spatial computing research group.
And, you know, and we have helped
contribute books, encyclopedias,
we help manage journals and, and
conferences and, and so on in the area.
And you also saw a recent
community visioning report in
which is recommended reading for
module eight.
And that you can see many more exciting
vision of current research ideas in
the community, okay?
Now our group specializes in two
sub-areas of spatial computing.
spatial databases,
which was the focus of another video.
And spatial data mining, which is
the focus of this particular video.
So starting roughly 99 we have started
working in this area, and, you know,
it all started with an NSF workshop which
brought in researchers from GIS and
data mining together.
Back in 99.
And, you know,
we after end of three days, you know,
I left with a kind of interesting feeling.
I felt that people could
do lot more in this space.
Most people were using the plain old
data mining for geography for data.
But there was potential to do more.
And lot of that you saw in module four
when we talked about spacial data mining.
You know,
we have spatial art of correlation.
We have continuity and so on and
you can do different things.
So in that particular module,
you saw the location prediction problem.
This was one of our first projects, and
we saw that if you make IAD assumption,
things don't go very well.
So to predict that bird nest it's
important to model art of correlation.
Another project shortly afterwards
was spatial outlier detection, and
you probably remember this diagram,
the freeway map of twin cities.
And the data from i35w
which is shown here.
And you remember sensor number nine
was behaving very different than
its neighboring sensors.
And this, this discontinuity was
formulied as spatial outlier.
You also remember the co-location
discussion in module four, and
this was a generalization
of association rules.
But, you know, overcoming
the challenges of lack of transactions.
Okay?
Beyond that,
we have now also recently completed
a very nice work on summarization.
You know, you probably remember and
Sat scan from module four.
So, currently if you think
about those techniques,
if you give them data
sets like road accident,
they would find ellipses as I've
shown in these two pictures.
Okay.
However, you may realize that, you know,
if the data set is really constrained by
the road network a better summarization is
by routes, by network concepts.
So in our group just got completed on KMR.
Which instead of finding
ellipses it finds routes.
Which have very high
concentration of activities.
Okay.
Now, going beyond that, you know,
let me give you two other ex,
you know, or three other examples of
things that are going on in our group.
So, first, let's start with core location.
Remember in core location,
you were given a set of, you know,
features, and several, several instances
of those features and a map of those, and
we were looking for pairs of features, or
triple of features which were co-located.
Okay?
Now this work has been
extended to space and time.
Okay?
So now try to imagine we have
a set of crime reports, and
for each crime report we
know the location and time.
So maybe, you know,
if you're looking at a particular event,
such as bar closing around midnight
in many urban areas, you know,
we might find our time t equal
to 1 a couple of bars close.
Okay.
Now, shortly afterwards,
you see some minor crimes happening
around in the neighborhood.'
'Kay?
And shortly afterwards, you see drunk
driving rates a little bit further down.
So when you see data sets like that,
we can essentially define a pattern called
cascade, and
summarize it using this simple diagram.
And what this is essentially
indicating is that in some areas,
in downtowns with very,
very large you now, dense population.
Bar closing events are often by assaults,
you know, little time,
you know shortly afterwards in that,
immediate neighborhood.
Or drunk driving a race little bit further
down, you know, shortly afterwards.
And this is called a cascade pattern.
And this maybe a better summarization
than simply looking at the map.
Okay.
So our group, there was a thesis completed
with a DOD research funding, and you can,
if you are interested, you can see more
details in this IEEE Transactions paper.
Okay?
We also extended colocations
to moving objects.
And to illustrate that,
let me show you this example.
And here we have trajectories
of many moving objects.
The object type is being
shown by the color.
Okay, so, you know,
there are some people moving around here.
And there are some heavy
vehicles moving around here.
And the question is to,
you know, is following.
Do you see pairs of colors,
or subsets of three colors
which are often together in space and
time even though they are moving.
And as you can imagine.
So I'll, you know, you may want
to pause the video here and, and
look for those patterns, okay?
And so I assumed you did that, so
when you come back you will probably find
the pair blue and red moving together.
And that's the highest interaction.
You might even see yellow involved
in that a little bit, okay?
Now again for small data sets,
you can do that manually.
But as the number of trajectory and
vehicle types increases you
need smart algorithms to sort
through those and rank them.
And these results are reported in another
IEEE transaction paper here that you
can take a look at.
Okay, so
let's talk about a current project.
What are we doing right now?
And one of the interesting project
has to do with looking for
hard spots of activities.
In patterns of evasion.
Okay?
So this is motivated from analysis of se,
serial crime.
So if you go to environmental
criminology literature they often talk
about an interesting phenomena called,
doughnut hole patterns.
And where do they come from?
'Kay?
And here, here is the theory.
So if you imagine there is activity
generator, like a serial criminal.
Then, you know, it has been observed
that they don't commit crime in their
immediate neighborhood because
their neighbors know them and
they can kind of report them back.'
Kay?
But then they don't go too far either,
because there is transportation cost.
Okay?
So
if you really see what the current
crime pattern footprint will look like.
It will look like a doughnut hole.
Sort of like this, you see these
red dots are the activities and
it will kind of be scattered
in a ring-like manner, okay?
Now this has been observed for
a long time in police work and
people have actually mapping and manual
techniques called geography profiling.
So once they have connected
these crimes by their M.O.
And they want to know where
the serial criminal may be living.
They essentially go inside this hole and
they try to do screening in there.
Okay.
But the big question is,
could we design algorithms,
fast algorithms to find these patterns?
And with one current grant we are exactly
exploiting that problem okay.
So first.
We simplified the problem a little bit
to make it computationally practical.
.
So, we assumed that these, you know,
doughnut holes are concentric rings,
okay just to reduce computational cost.
So, in terms of the problem in input and
output, you're given a set of
activities and their location.
You know, for example, here.
So these red dots in this map is
essentially showing you arson.
Again, there are people, you know,
who start fire by their,
you know, weaknesses, and
many of them become serial.
So this is an example
from Southern California.
Okay?
So a lot of arsons started by same person,
same MO.
Okay in addition, you know,
these things we want to be very,
very sure that we 're not really you know,
trying to harass people who are innocent.
So that's where you want
statistical significance,
very much like sat scan okay?
And then the output is ring shaped
hotspots which are statistically
significant okay?
So in this particular case you see some
red dots down below, some over here.
And the output are these rings
that are shown in green.
And with each green, we have
statistical parameters, the P value and
the confidence measure.
Okay, so the idea is to give statistically
rings, you know, a very very quickly.
So this work just started,
you know, we have a paper in
in December, so really fresh,
you know, hot off the press.
and, and this thesis it will be ongoing.
So again just to acknowledge you know,
this particular work was actually
sponsored by department of defense.
And here are some of our
other current grants.
Which is, sponsoring other activities.
In fact through other videos, you would
come across what else is happening.
So for example, this expedition
understanding climate, a driven approach.
I am a copyi.
And we will have a video interview of
professor Vipin Kumar, who is the PI and
you can see some data mining work there.
You'll also meet you'll
also will meet Len Kenay,
who is heading this initiative
called used spatial.
Which provides spatial services
to the entire campus okay?
So again, it's a wide range
of projects down here, and
we are very, very grateful to the sponsors
who sponsored this, this kind of project.
So, thank you for your attention.
You got a sense of another research
project in my group, and hopefully,
through other videos,
you can see what other people are doing in
the campus, as well as around the country.
