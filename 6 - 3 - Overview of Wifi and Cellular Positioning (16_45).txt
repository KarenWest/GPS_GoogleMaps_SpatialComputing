Welcome back to the positioning module.
In the last video, we discussed
global navigation satellite systems,
like the global positioning system or GPS.
Now, while these systems have made
the accurate estimation of one's position
much, much, much easier than it was
before, they also have some drawbacks.
Most notably,
they don't work well indoors.
The accuracy of these navigation
satellite systems can be limited for
certain applications.
The time to first position fix, or
the time to getting that first location,
can also be quite limited or it,
it basically it takes too long.
Global navigation satellite systems
don't work well in dense urban areas.
Remember, we talked about
this urban canyon effect.
I showed you that picture from Toronto and
showed you where GPS won't work well.
And then lastly, GPS and similar
systems can be a drain on power for
your smartphone, for instance.
Now, some of these limitations
are pretty serious.
For instance, many people
around the world, including me,
spend most of our time indoors, and for
these people, GPS and other GNSSs, or
other Global Navigation Satellite Systems,
won't work most of the time, right?
That's a big deal.
They don't work most of the time.
Now, this is particularly a problem given
that many people in both academia and
industry believe one of
the next frontiers of
spatial computing will
be the indoors domain.
Now, you've already seen movement in this
indoor direction with the introduction of
Google's Indoor Maps and
navigation instructions.
For instance,
here's Google mapping, excuse me,
routing me from one end of
the Mall of America to the other.
The Mall of America is located
just south of Minneapolis, and
it's the largest mall
in the United States.
So, it's about what, ten miles from here.
And it's so big that, believe me,
navigation instructions can be incredibly
useful when you're trying to shop at
multiple locations at the Mall of America,
but without good indoor positioning, for
instance, if we just relied on GPS we
wouldn't be able to do these types of
navigation applications, at least not
from your current location, right?
So, this is where WiFi
positioning comes to the rescue.
WiFi positioning works
quite well indoors and
in places that GPS signals
have trouble reaching.
Like, for instance, the urban
canyons I was just talking about.
Now, because of these advantages, the vast
majority of smartphones supplement GPS
positioning with WiFi positioning.
Now, the intuition behind WiFi positioning
is pretty straightforward, and
to understand this intuition let's pretend
you somehow got on the wrong airplane and
needed to figure out
where you were landing.
Now, as the plane approached the runway,
you saw the following, let's pretend
you saw the following landmarks.
So Coit Tower, Candlestick Park, and
then here's the real giveaway,
the Golden Gate Bridge.
Now, from these three landmarks,
it's pretty easy to tell that
you're in San Francisco.
WiFi positioning works the same way,
except instead of considering well
known human understandable landmarks,
WiFi positioning considers WiFi access
points one of which may be sitting in
your living room right now, and each of
which has a unique MAC or mac address.
Because it uses these access points,
WiFi positioning is able to deliver much
more accurate positions than just a city.
And in fact, WiFi access points,
excuse me, WiFi positioning,
can deliver a relatively accurate
latitude and longitude coordinate.
At a more detailed level,
most WiFi positioning systems work through
an approach known as fingerprinting.
Now, fingerprinting consists
of two separate phases.
The first phase is known as
the calibration or the offline phase.
And the second phase is the positioning or
the online phase.
Now in the calibration phase the goal
is what are known as WiFi fingerprints.
Generally speaking these,
these fingerprints consists of a, a MAC or
a M.A.C. address.
All WiFi access points have these.
And they're unique to
each WiFi access point.
The fingerprint also consists of a signal
strength as well as the location at
which the fingerprint was collected,
right?
So we have the MAC address, excuse me,
MAC addresses of the available networks,
their signal strengths, and the location
of the fingerprint collector at
the time these signal strengths and
the MAC addresses were observed.
Now, one thing you don't see here is
the password to the WiFi networks,
the name of the WiFi networks,
WiFi network owners, et cetera, et cetera.
And this is actually
a really critical point.
The use of WiFi access points in
WiFi positioning actually does
not require access to the access
point's actual network, right?
It doesn't actually require
you to join the WiFi network.
It just requires geographic knowledge
of the access point's existence.
Although this simplifies things a bit,
you can think of a WiFi fingerprint as
simply the name of the WiFi networks and
the signal strengths of these networks
measured at a specific location.
So, in other words, the list of available
WiFi networks on your computer,
your tablet, your smartphone, etc,
is two thirds of a fingerprint,
with the actual position of your
device being the final one third.
Just as you don't need the passwords to
these networks to know that they're there,
WiFi positioning systems don't need access
to WiFi networks to use them as landmarks.
So, now that we know what a fingerprint
is, how are they collected?
Well, this process can happen
in one of several ways.
It used to be that the predominant means
fingerprints were collected was through
a really awesomely named
process called war driving.
Now, war driving basically involves
a company hiring people to
drive around cities
gathering WiFi fingerprints.
Or in other words, hiring people
to drive around measuring which
WiFi access points are visible and what
their signal strengths are, and doing so
at hundreds of thousands of
different locations around a city.
Now, you may have seen one
of these cars at some point.
This is the Google Street View,
the famous Google Street View car, or
an example of a Google Street View car.
Google famously, and actually,
infamously, used the same cars it used to
capture street view images to
collect WiFi fingerprints.
And of course,
doing this makes a ton of sense, right?
If you're already going to drive down
every single road in every single city to
collect pictures of these roads, you might
as well also collect WiFi fingerprints to
help with WiFi positioning in these areas.
Now, if you have a WiFi
access point in your home,
chances are this access point was
observed by a Street View car,
added to Google's database,
and is now being used for
WiFi positioning on Android devices when
they're in the vicinity of your home.
Perhaps even the Android
devices that you own.
Now, Google got into a bit of trouble
during this process because in
addition to collecting basic
fingerprint information,
Street view cars also collected data
that was being transmitted over
unencrypted wireless networks as
these Street View cars drove by.
You may have read this story in the news,
it's actually still an unfolding story, so
hopefully you have a bit more context
to understand this current event
a bit better.
Now, these days, war driving for
Wi-Fi fingerprints is becoming old news.
War driving is expensive, and
companies like Apple, Google, and
Microsoft realized that they had access to
a huge group of people who are willing to
scour the earth looking for
Wi-Fi fingerprints totally for free.
And, that huge group of
people includes me and
almost anyone else who owns
a smartphone probably including you.
Now, as we go about our business,
our smartphones are periodically sending
information about nearby WiFi access
points, their signal strengths, and
the smartphone's GPS position,
so basically,
entire WiFi fingerprints, our smartphones
are sending these fingerprints back to
the owners of the their operating systems
and doing so in an anonymized fashion.
So, for instance, as I walk around
the University of Minnesota's campus,
if I walk around downtown my iPhone is
constantly looking at my GPS position or
my true position and looking at what Wi-Fi
networks are around me and sending, and
their signals strengths, and
sending this information back up
to home base or back up to Apple.
For instance, in a FAQ about how
Apple does Wi-Fi positioning,
Apple discloses that positioning
calculations are performed on the iPhone
using a crowdsourced database of Wi-Fi
hotspot and cell tower data that is
generated by tens of millions of iPhones,
sending the geo-tagged locations of near,
nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers in
an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple.
So, this is actually the source of
the consolidated.db scandal which many of
you might remember from 2011.
You'll recall this map.
It's a very prem prominent part
of the consolidated.db scandal.
And effectively what was going on
here is Apple was caching entries in
this Wi-Fi fingerprint database,
this crowdsourced database on an iPhone.
And when you synced your
iPhone with a computer and
you didn't tell your synced copy of
the information to be encrypted,
it would actually just store
these cached Wi-Fi fingerprints.
And from these fingerprints, right,
these cached fingerprints were coming from
places nearby where you had traveled.
So when these fingerprints could be
discovered from an unencrypted file
it raised a number of
important privacy concerns.
And since then, Apple has taken a number
of steps, to reduce this problem, and
reduce its effect.
Okay, so we've covered how Wi-fi
fingerprints are collected in
the calibration, or the offline phase.
The second phase in which,
the second phase in fingerprint-based
Wi-fi positioning is of
course using the collected fingerprints
to actually predict a location.
This is known as the positioning phase.
Now, this prediction is generally done
using machine learning methods, and
while the details of these
methods can get somewhat complex,
the intuition behind them is
really quite straightforward.
Basically, your smartphone or
other device scans for available Wi-Fi
networks and their signal strengths.
And then the Wi-Fi positioning system
tries to predict the location of your
smartphone by matching these available
networks and their strengths to the Wi-Fi,
to Wi-Fi fingerprints in the Wi-Fi
positioning systems database.
So for example, if your smartphone sees
these networks, excuse me, sees that
these networks are available in your area
the Wi-Fi positioning system will look for
similar entries in the Wi-Fi
fingerprints database.
And, for instance, return the most
similar fingerprint's longitude and
latitude coordinate as
the smartphone's current position.
So this process can actually result
in a relatively accurate position.
So in general, you can think of
Wi-Fi positioning's accuracy as
being somewhere between GPS when there
are sufficient number of satellites, and
cellular positioning,
which we'll talk about in a little bit.
So it has worse accuracy than GPS,
better accuracy than cellular.
I mean, a really wonderful paper, it's
one of my favorite papers in this area.
Paul Zandbergen, it's a paper in
a journal called Transactions in GIS.
Paul Zandbergen discusses
the relative accuracy of
several different positioning methods.
In the paper, he points out that Sky Hub
wireless which was a real pioneer in
Wi-fi positioning claimed, 20 meter,
20 meter accuracy on its system,
at least as of 2008.
In his tests in the Albuquerque area,
he found that Wi-Fi positioning
was actually somewhat worse.
It had a 74 meters median accuracy.
Another thing that's important to discuss
when it comes to Wi-Fi positioning
accuracy is that Wi-Fi fingerprints and,
and GPS satellites can
actually be combined in what is known
as a hybrid positioning system.
In difficult positioning
contexts like urban canyons,
these hybrid systems generally
have better accuracy and
faster position delivery times
than either approach alone.
So, for instance,
here's Skyhook Wireless again.
Skyhook offers a hybrid
positioning system, and
here's what they have to say about it.
Skyhook Location's hybrid
positioning improves upon
Wi-fi positioning accuracy up to
35% in difficult environments by
leveraging signals from as
few as two GPS satellites.
In deep urban settings,
Skyhook Location uses weak GPS signals and
WiFi to acquire a location
100% of the time.
Whereas A-GPS, which is a,
you can think of it as an enhanced version
of GPS, works only 70% of the time.
From a complete cold start,
Skyhook Location delivers a full hybrid
location in four seconds compared to 30 to
60 seconds for this enhanced GPS system.
In general, the accuracy of any
WisFi positioning system is going to
be dependent on three factors.
The first of these factors is the number
of access points available in
the location that a device
needs a position.
So the more Wi-fi access points that are
around when you need a current position,
the better the position.
Now, the second factor is related.
It's the quality of
the fingerprint's database.
And this is going to degrade over time and
is going to be worse in certain
environmental conditions.
With the, with respect to degrading
over time, you can imagine.
I know I've moved a lot
in the last couple years.
I bring my Wi-Fi access point with me.
They're going to have to update
the location of that access point, or
else you'll get spurious conditions,
right?
So I moved from Northwestern which
is near Chicago, to Minnesota.
If they didn't update the a,
the location of my Wi-Fi access point,
they might think that someone
around here is actually in Chicago.
Okay, and the final,
predictor of performance in
a Wi-Fi positioning system
is pretty straightforward.
It's the quality of the machine learning
algorithm used in the positioning phase.
Now, the first item on this list is,
in my view, particularly critical.
Wi-Fi positioning works
well in dense urban areas,
which is great because this is
one area where GPS tends to fail.
However, Wi-Fi positioning
does not work well in rural
areas where Wi-Fi access points
are quite sparsely distributed.
So for
instance my dad is a hydrologist, and
when I was young, he use to bring me and
my brothers up to McCarthy, Alaska.
Where did a lot of, a lot of field work.
McCarthy is in, in,
in an extremely rural area.
And most places you go in this area
have zero Wi-Fi access points in range.
So, in other words,
if I take out my smartphone and
try to see what Wi-Fi networks are around
most places I go anywhere near
McCarthy the answer is going to be that
there is zero Wi-Fi networks in range.
In McCarthy and and at places like at even
much less rural places Wi-Fi positioning
is effectively useless, actually.
A final point I want to make about Wi-Fi
positioning is that it has an important
advantage that is not often considered
when people compare positioning methods.
Namely, Wi-Fi positioning works
on many more devices than GPS.
While most smartphones have GPS and
GLONASS as I was talking about earlier,
at least modern smartphones.
This is not true of most tablets and
nearly all computers.
Tablets and
computers do not have access to these
global navigation satellite systems.
Tablets and computers do, however,
almost always have Wi-fi capabilities, and
as such, they can use Wi-fi positioning.
Okay, so, for example, let's go ahead and
open up my,
Maps application on my MacBook here.
Once again my MacBook does
not have access to the global
navigation satellite systems,
like my smartphone would.
And you can see here,
my Mac knows where I am.
And that is because it has access to
Apple's Wi-Fi positioning system,
most likely the same one
that is used on iPhones.
We're in the same, same place we've
been recording most of these MOOC,
MOOC videos and it,
it correctly knows that.
Now, watch what happens when I
turn off my Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi chip,
turn off the ability of my
computer to access Wi-Fi networks.
Positioning goes away.
It no longer knows where I am, and
that's because it no longer has access to
the available Wi-Fi networks and
their signal strengths.
And if I hit the Position button here,
it'll tell me, I can't show your position,
you're going to have to turn on
Wi-fi in order for this to work.
So I'm turning it on, and,
boom, the position is back.
Okay, so we've now covered two
of the three ways that your
smartphone knows where you are.
Two of the three ways that your
smartphone can gather a position.
I'm just briefly going to talk
about cellular positioning.
These days, it's the least important.
It's definitely the least accurate.
So let's just go over it quickly here.
Cellular positioning is
an older method of positioning.
There are a number of
algorithms available, for
instance, one straightforward algorithm
is just using the location of
the nearest cell tower or the cell tower
with the greatest signal strength.
There's also time difference on arrival
algorithms, angle of arrival algorithms,
and of course, fingerprinting.
The accuracy of cellular positioning is
highly dependent on the number of towers.
So, again, we have better accuracy
in urban areas than in rural areas.
And cellular positioning is once again
the least accurate of the three.
So if you have access to GPS and
Wi-Fi and you can
get positions from those you can probably
ignore cellular positioning unless it
provides you with something that's
useful in a hybrid positioning context.
So to give you an example of the
accuracies of, of cellular positioning.
You'll recall that Zandbergen
found that in Albuquerque,
Wi-Fi had a median accuracy of 74 meters,
while the equivalent for
cellular positioning was 599 meters.
Okay, that's it for Wi-Fi and
cellular positioning.
In the next video,
we're going to go ahead and
move on to content-based positioning,
which is one of my favorite subjects.
