Welcome to the modular and spatial data
mining, so for next half a dozen videos or
so we'll explore this topic of data mining
in context of geographic and spatial data
sense.
So in the very first video the learning
objectives are as follows.
It is after this module, after this video
you should
be able to talk about the motivation for
spatial data mining.
You know, what are the societal use cases,
what are the benefits, why people are
engaging in this, and second, we should
al,
also be able to name common pattern
families.
Which I explored with spatial data, okay?
So, so first let's look at the, the
overall context.
So, data mining is among a, a set or a
family of techniques that people use for
informed decision making.
Okay, and informed decision making has a
long history.
It's often considered better than gut
based, or instinct based,
decision making because one is able to see
a little
bit of information about the competition,
about the market, you
know, about different trends within the
organization, and so on, 'kay?
In recent times, informed decision making
has been
aided by technologies to collect data and
information.
These technologies include sensors as well
as databases.
So, for example, if you go to retail
stores.
So if you're shopping in Wal-Mart or
Target, you will probably note that
your transactions, so the set of items
that you buy, are being recorded
in a database, and these stores then look
through those transactions to identify
many different patterns, such as which
items
sell together, because once they know
that.
They can use different strategies such as
lost you know, leaders strategies.
Where they put one item on sale and make
money on
the other, and similarly if you're on a
website, such as Amazon.com.
Almost every click that you make whether
you're on Facebook or so on.
Those are recorded and people again look
at different patterns.
For example, e-commerce companies often
are interested in a selection of
colors, fonts, or other tactics to
increase click rates on advertisement,
okay.
Now as you come to spatial word, if you're
using a
smartphone, it has GPS, then your
locations are being recorded, okay.
So all these sensors, you know, are
enabling data
collection, and then the advent of
relational databases has
made it very very cheap to archive large
amount
of data, and analyze them for their own
purposes.
However there is a challenge.
In past, this data was analyzed by human
experts, or analysts.
So they would essentially sit through
and try different statistical techniques,
and if
they found some patterns they will go
through further analysis to confirm it.
But with the rapid change in technology,
the rate of data collection is growing
very,
very fast, and certainly much faster than
number
of human analysts that an organization can
hire.
So, in this context we need, some
automation.
We need to help these human analysts.
To focus on most promising pattern, or the
patterns which seem to be most supported
by data.
Okay, some of you may have come across the
term big data, which is another
way to articulate the same vision.Okay, so
there
are many different approaches to assess to
humans.
Okay, so one simple approach we saw
earlier when we were looking at Query
languages.
So [INAUDIBLE] languages like SQL or even
simple Google search also help identify
simple subsets
of data and one can use simple
summary queries there also to find basic
[INAUDIBLE].
Now spacial data mining is another
technique and it's a little bit different.
It's able to answer more complex
questions.
So let's first look at the difference
between
these two techniques, and also we should
realize that
there are other techniques, such as
visualization and so
on, which are there to help human
analysts, okay?
But, at least in this course we would have
looked at spatial equating already.
That was the module on spatial equating
languages, and we are going to look at
spacial data mining in this module so
let's
at least compare and contrast these two
techniques.
So what is the difference between spatial
equating and spatial data mining, okay.
So assuming you have already watched the
videos and
gone through the exercise in a spatial
query language.
Here are some limitations of query
languages that you know, we can go over.
So, first, the query languages like SQL
work with with a closed word exemption.
In other words, if some information is not
in
the database, these query languages can
not create that.
They essentially will answer false.
So now try to imagine many interesting
questions such as the following.
Suppose you want to predict the weather
for tomorrow.
So as you can imagine, a database can only
contain history, it can have data for
yesterday, day before.
You know, here before and so on.
But given all that information, if you ask
a database SQL query about weather
tomorrow, it
essentially will come back and say, I
don't
know, or essentially give you an empty
answer.
So it does not have a way to estimate or
create things which are not in database.
Another such example is the following.
If you, let's say, are looking at credit
worthiness.
So the way it is, credit card companies,
you know, they get applications, and the
database
they may have thousands of past
applications and
their decisions, whether they were
accepted or denied.
But given all that information, if you ask
the database whether a new
application should be approved or
declined, database
SQL would not have much to say.
In addition,you know, the [INAUDIBLE]
complexity in databases are limited.
If you remember in SQL we learned about
simple selection and join.
We could use spatial relationships for
those, but, Join
Inside is still very limited to simply
form pairs.
If you want to go beyond pairs, to ask for
groups.
You know, for example you are looking at
all the
customers who are buying a new product,
such as iPhone
and or, a completely new part, and you
want to
understand that are there some natural
groups of customers there.
So data basis and SQL would have a very
hard
time finding these because these are much
more complex than
join okay, and other, you know, such
queries are given
a set of items, in a retail store like
Wal-Mart.
You want to ask which items are often
bought together.
You know, looking at customer
transactions.
Again this credit turns start to be much
more complex than joined.
In SQL, the traditional one will not be
able to help you.
So, in such context, the role for data
mining.
Data mining is able to use database in
new, creative ways.
So for example, it can do prediction.
So if we already know the weather for
yesterday, day before and so
on, then we could use prediction model to
estimate the weather for tomorrow.
So oftentimes they would essentially have
the
weather for many geographic location, so
if
they notice a storm is moving at certain
velocity or speed in a certain direction.
They can project, and predict where it
will be that, tomorrow,
and based on that they could even predict
the local weather.
It may not be 100% accurate, but at least
there is a prediction, and that is often
quite useful.
Similarly other complex questions such as
natural
groups can be answered in data mining,
okay?
So, in that sense, if you think about
spatial querying and data mining, then
querying often focuses
on what is in the database, that is, the
parts, and it can give you a summary
of the parts, but estimate querying will
not
try to to estimate something that's not in
the
database, and that's where the spatial
data mining
comes into play, it can try to do
forecast.
And it can also enter, answer more complex
questions which are difficult to express
using joins, okay.
So let's formally define spatial data
mining.
So there are many different definitions.
So, but, for our discussion, the following
definition would be a reasonable place to
start.
So it is a process of discovering
patterns.
So here, you notice, we put the word
patterns in red
color, and then there are three objectives
in front of that.
So let's go over all the three objectives.
So, first objective is non trivial.
So these patterns are non trivial.
It essentially means that if I look at
the brewed first approach, and say, well
Let me
look at possible candidates, and then
somehow rank
them to get the most useful and
interesting one.
Then that's going to take a very long
time,
because the set of candidates is very very
large.
In other words, this nontriviality is
motivating use of computer algorhythms.
To sort through candidates to identify
most interesting one.
The second objective is useful.
This is essentially telling us that data
mining is an applied field of research.
There is always a customer on the other
end.
So there is an organization, maybe a
business, a government, or a consumer.
Who has a certain goal and these patterns
are going to be used by this customer.
It is not basic research, it is not basic
research you just don't
take a theory and extend it to say here is
another beautiful thing.
That's often not done it data mining.
It maybe done modern machine learning or
statistical
theory, and finally the third objective is
interesting.
So the patterns we find should give us new
knowledge.
They should give us some surprised or
difference.
It should not be something people already
know.
So for example, you know, if we look at
climate data
for last several decades or centuries, and
ask for some correlations,.
You know you might find correlations such
as the climate in Minneapolis.
It is very similar to climate in St. Paul,
but if
you ask the, you know, most people, that
won't be very interesting,
because people know that nearby places
have similar climate, and given
that St. Paul and Minneapolis are only
about a dozen miles apart.
That's something most people will expect
so it's not interesting.
However if you know, analyzing the same
client history data somebody
notices a pattern that warming of pacific
leads to milder winters
in Minnesota that is certainly interesting
because most people or not
aware of these teleconnections at least
they were not aware of that.
In a few decades ago, with more climate
research we have seen these kind of
connections.
So interesting it has to do with some
novelty, something that's not normal.
But again, the keywords are patterns and
what
we'll do slowly is to give you examples
of those so that you form and indution
about the kinds of patterns we work with.
In terms of interestingness, you know, the
patterns,
themselves, could be of interest to non
spatialists.
So, for example, when I mentioned that
Pacific
warming, also called El Nino, affects
winters in Minnesota.
People who are not familiar with climate
science and data, may find it interesting.
But people who already know this actually
may
be more interested in when these patterns
are violated.
So when are the exceptions?
For example, global warming is another
trend that has been noticed
for the last several decades, and but you
know, there are anomalies.
For example, we know that in last decade
we
know that the rate of global warming has
slowed.
So the specialist, the climate scientists,
are more interested in
that anomaly to figure out where is the
heat going, okay?
So there are different ways to talk about
interesting this, okay?
Also in our contexts, we are looking at
very large data sets,
So computers scalability to large data
sets is also a factor here, okay?
Okay, good.
So let's go down and look at the pattern
families that we are
interested in, and in spatial data
mining there are several interesting
pattern families.
We'll give you examples of a couple of
those.
So here is a quick list.
Hotspots, and I'll show you an example
very quickly.
People talk spatial discontinuities, or
spatial outliers, poll locations.
Location prediction model, etc.
So, let's go look at an example of each,
okay.
So the first one, Hotspots.
So hotspots, probably, are the most
popular pattern familied
in spatial data, and they have a very
interesting history.
So let me first take you, you know, to the
historic example, in London, 1854.
So here you are seeing a very historic
map, drawn by John Snow.
Some of you may have seen this map
in others courses on visualization or in
public health.
So at this time people did not understand
the cause for cholera.
In fact, the prevalent theory said that
cholera is spread through air, and it's a
bad air or miasma theory, okay, and based
on that, you know, people managed their
cities.
You know, if you remember, this is the
time when the cities are just emerging.
Say it is like New York and London you
know, they essentially assume that you
know, when if you have some dirty places
you know, they are thinking in terms of
chemistry and saying even if you have a
water well next to it as long as
you're digging deep enough chemistry says
the toxins
will dilute and your water quality is
fine.
So even in cities like London and New
York, you know things are not that
clean at this time in 1854, and it results
in many of you know these diseases.
But in 1854, John Snow, a public
health official in London, tries a
different approach.
He puts a, a together a map, and in this
map he's showing the locations of debts.
So when you see these little dots in this
map,
they are showing you the locations of
debts due to cholera.
Now once he looks at this map of London,
he finds a very interesting pattern.
What now a days we call hot spots, so you
notice that these deaths are concentrated
in a geographic area.
They are not uniformly distributed all
over
London, but they are concentrated in this
area.
Not only that, he also notices that there
is a water pump.
You know, these big black boxes are water
pumps,
and he notices areas have water pumps at
the center.
Of this hard spot.
So [UNKNOWN] comes up with the hypothesis,
a conjecture.
It says well, maybe this water pump has
something to
do with cholera, but the scientific theory
at the time
says that cholera is spread through air,
so no one
believes John Snow, and it takes him three
or four days.
To convince city council to just take a
chance,
he simply argues that, you know, what's
the harm?
Let's take the handle off and see what is
does
and very reluctantly city council does
that and then Cholera subsides.
So this essentially is a big change in
scientific thinking.
So the pattern here is hotspot and based
on
that we also created a hypothesis that the
things at
the center of the hotspot may be cause of
this
pattern, and it actually helps you know
control the disease.
So science changes at this point an
alternative
hypothesis is born which says cholera may
be spread
through water, and the people start
putting microscopered the
water and 20 years later germ theory comes
around.
And you know, that changes the way we
think about cholera today.
Not only that, many other diseases which
are waterborne.
You know, the whole notion of germ comes
around.
So again to back up, for our course what
is interesting is
the pattern, and what we are interested in
are these hotspot pattern.
Which are roughly a geographic area inside
which the
concentration of some activity is much
higher than outside.
This activity could be disease it could be
something else, so
this pattern is routinely checked for by
Center for Disease control.
Many public health agencies routinely make
maps
of infectious disease, and if they find
an area where this concentration is much
higher than outside, they often launch
environmental investigation.
Now, this pattern has moved from public
health to also public
safety and you can do the same analysis
with crime locations.
So many police departments today make a
map of
all the crime reports every week, and they
they look
for geographic areas where the crime
density is very high,
and if they find that, then they try
different interventions.
For example, they may increase police
patrol, or they may
have social inter, intervention and things
of that kind, okay?
So this is first pattern family, with a
very
long history and it's used quite a bit
today.
Let's look at second pattern family, but
before that we
will show you that hot spot today has more
semantics.
Okay, so, John [UNKNOWN] where you had a
single map
and one disease in a small area is long
way.
Today, you have to monitor very, very
large areas, so that
your software tools are interesting but in
addition you had more semantics.
Okay, for example, you may have time and
in urban areas, you may even have spatial
network.
So let me very quickly show you the impact
of those.
So here in this picture we are showing you
crime locations in a
large city in US and you can try
traditional hot spots to find
this ellipses where the crime density is
high, but in many urban areas, which also
have sparse aid locations, some crimes are
generated a long transportation network.
So in the same data site, if you notice,
if I think in terms
of roads you may find that certain
roads have high concentration of these
activities.
So linear hotspots are often [INAUDIBLE]
and actually if you look at
it in full richness there is an animation
of crime activities in Amsterdam,
and you notice that over 24 hours of a
day, which is
shown by this clock, the, the locations
and intensity of crime changes, okay.
So there are new semantics to hotspots
which are being explored today, okay.
So let's go look at another pattern
family, and
this is sort of in some sense opposite of
hotspots.
These are spatial discontinuities or
outliers, and
in this case, you know, we are
going to show you a quick example of
traffic data in twin cities and
so, many you know, modern cities have a
lot of sensors on the highways
to monitor traffic and you know, they can
quickly traffic issues and resolve them.
So, we are showing you a map of twin
cities.
You know, many applicant fall in Minnesota
and this, these are the major
highways here, and you're seeing roughly
4000 sensors every mile on the highway
there are sensors which give you the data,
now on this you know
let me maybe show you a subset of the data
for one highway I-35.
Which goes like, you know, this direction
north, south, and if I show
this data for a day, then this is what it
may look like.
So on the y axis, I have given you
locations of sensors
on I-35W, one of the interstate, and these
sensors are mile apart.
There are roughly 60 sensors.
On the x axis, I'm showing time of the
day.
So you're starting with midnight on the
left
hand, morning, then noon, afternoon, and
night, okay.
The color coding here is showing you
traffic levels,
so red means high traffic, blue means no
traffic, okay?
So in this particular picture, you can see
many many patterns.
So for example you can see rush hour in
the morning.
You know, to have shower in the evening.
It is showing you only one direction of
the highway.
If you see the other direction, it will be
mirror image, okay?
But the pattern of interest that I want to
talk about is this sensor number nine.
You notice this line, okay, this line is
sensor number
nine and there is something very strange
about this sensor.
If you have ever observed traffic or maps
in general, okay?
So first notice that individual reading of
the sensor.
So if I go and look at the individual
sensor.
So if I go and look at the individual
colors here.
They are not global outliers.
There is plenty of this magenta color in
this map, okay?
Yet the sensor looks very strange.
So if I, you may want to pause here and
think about why it looks so strange, and
you, you know,
you realize that this sensor nine is
detecting traffic, even though
the sensor before and after does not
detect any traffic, okay?
So, this is an example of spatial
discontinuities, and
it's happening all the, you know, the
entire day, okay?
These things are very unusual in space
because
many phenomenon in space, they vary
smoothly Okay?
If you look at temperature.
Look at precipitation, and same way look
at highway traffic.
Then, you know, most people don't really
know immediately enter the freeway and
exit.
You know, a few might do that.
But most people go several miles on a
freeway.
So, this discontinuity is strange, and you
know, one of our
project, we had this data and when we
flagged this pattern
and showed it to the local department of
transport officials, they
thought it was a bad sensor and they
changed that, okay?
So again, any discontinuities in space is
interesting
and you know, we call that spatial
outline.
Let's look at the third pattern family,
what we call
predictive models, and here again we'll
show you an example.
So first we are showing you a map of the
red [INAUDIBLE] near
Lake Erie, one of the Great Lakes, and you
see the green areas.
These are vegetation, and then you can see
little dark, you know,
the crosses, around here, and these are
nests of a particular bird.
So in this example, people wanted to
create a model to predict nest worthy
sites.
So that you know, if there is a
development, if they want to build a house
or freeway, they can try to protect the
damage or impact on the bird's nest, okay?
So we basically want to predict the
locations where this
bird likes to nest, and you, you have that
information available.
So, for example you may have vegetation
durability index, you may have distance to
water,
and many other geography variables that
are
available using which we can make this
prediction.
Again, on the surface of this this may
look like many other
prediction problems that you may have seen
in different states on machine learning.
But we'll come back to this pattern family
later on
to discuss why this problem may require
additional attention, okay.
But, basically, we are doing location
prediction in this case.
Whether it's the location of a bird nest,
or location of where a hurricane
will land, or a location of which a
tornado will go and so on.
But we're essentially trying to prediction
location
and time based on many Geography
variables.
The last [INAUDIBLE] family we want to
talk about, is co location, and
again let me first give you a picture, to
try to motivate this pattern.
So here, suppose I gave a map, of this
kind, and this map has many features.
So for example you may see Blue birds.
There are many Blue bird nests, one here,
one there, here, here, here, and so on.
You might see green trees, again there are
many locations of green trees,
or fire, or dry tree, and so on or another
kind of bird.
So given a map of many, many features such
as bluebird nests, you know,
green tree, dry tree, fire, house, the
question we are asking is the following.
Is, are there pairs or triples of these
even types.
You know, whose locations are often
together.
Okay so whose instances are often located
together in space.
So again it will be best for us to pause
this video here for a few second and
you may want to stare at this map and see
if you can identify at least one pair.
Where the locations are often together,
okay?
So, you know, assuming you have already
done that, I'll show you, you know,
the two patterns that many people will
find in this picture are the following.
So first, many people will say dry tree
and fire
are co-located, and you can start seeing
those pairs here.
So on the right hand side you see dry
tree, fire.
A lot of them, you know, lot of them here.
Blue bird and house.
Again, you will see these pairs a lot of
time in this map, OK, so not
all houses have bluebird, like this house
doesn't
have bluebird but, you know, most of them
have.
So these are often thought of as a
co-location pattern.
We can ask similar questions with retail
stores and ask which retail store types.
Tend to co-locate, you know, things of
that kind but this is the fourth pattern.
Okay, so, you know, so having shown you
many positive
examples of spatial data mining I also
want to quickly
go over and tell you what is not spatial
data
mining and the reason I think it's
important is the following.
The term data mining started in mid-90s
and, you know, at that time,
the meaning was very specific, but then it
took a life of its own.
You know, media and all kinds of people
love to
use this phrase and they stretch the
meaning, and you know,
today if you see the word data mining used
in literature,
it may mean lots of lots of things,
particularly in media.
But in this course, we are going to stick
to the scientific meaning.
Which is little bit more specific.
So here are the things we do not consider
data mining.
So first is simple query.
As I told you if you are using some basic
SQL join or select, that's querying,
that's not data mining.
So if you do Google search, yeah, some
media article may call it
data mining, but in this course we will
not call that dat mining.
'Kay, so you remember in spatial query
languages, we were able
to use SQL simple joins to find neighbors
of a country.
Or, you know, we can go to Google and find
shortest
path on a road map, and these are not
considered data mining.
Same way, you know, if you came from
statistics side, you may have done
hypothesis testing.
Even though statistical hypothesis testing
is often done after data mining.
But that itself is not, you know,
considered data mining.
The reason is is that the set of
hypotheses is very small, okay.
So if you are only looking at one
hypothesis,
such as, you know, some of you remember
the
movie Erin Brockovich, and you know, she
found this
cancer cluster in California, and they won
a major lawsuit.
But if you think about her problem, and
scientifically it may be thought of as a
very
simple thing, a simple hypothesis asking
whether cancer incidence
rates are much higher inside Hinkley than
outside, okay?
It will not be considered [UNKNOWN] per se
because there is only hypothesis, okay?
Of course, if we didn't know the location
Hinkley, and you
wanted to ask this question for all
possible locations in California
or United States or worldwide then it may
become data mining
because the number of locations is very,
very large and potentially infinite.
Also the shape of the footprint and so on,
okay.
The third part, you know, which we talked
about.
You know, remember the objective about
interesting.
So if we are mining for pattern which
are well known or obvious that's not data
mining.
So just like, you know, if you said well
if St.
Paul is warm today you know Minneapolis
will also be warm.
You know most people know it's not
interesting, okay.
However teleconnections which many of us
are not aware
of, and you know, those maybe more
interesting that a
remote area such as Pacific warming
effects in winters
and Minnesota, and there are many other
such [UNKNOWN] connections.
North Atlantic oscillation you know, which
is sort of the near
green land, that seems to effect weather
in Europe and so on.
Okay, and finally, in this course, we
are not interested in non-spatial data or
pattern.
So, for example, in the data mining world,
there is a very famous pattern
which, you know, Wal-Mart found, saying
that
diaper and beer sales are correlated,
okay?
If you look at that patent per say it is
relevant to data mining.
It's very interesting and many retailers
use such patterns to make money,
but if it has no special component it's
not of interest to
this course, and in fact you know if you
already know this
pattern you may want to ask yourself is
this pattern spacial or not?
So if you have ever read the complete
story it does have
spacial component because this pattern is
not true everywhere in the world.
It's only true in blue collar
neighborhoods, and in week day evening.
Because you know the anthropologist who
followed these shoppers and interviewed
them.
They found that many of them were young
fathers, and you know they got a call.
From home to pick up Diaper, you know, at
the end of the work day and while
they were there, you know, the
stereotypical, you know,
beer drinking folks, they also picked up
beer, okay?
So hopefully, you know, this discussion
gives you a sense of two things.
Number one, what's the motivation for Data
Mining?
You know why do we have to go beyond basic
you know, query?
And you saw that this equating cannot
answer complicated questions like groups.
It can also not predict things which are
outside database, and that's
where Data Mining can help, and second,
what is Spatial Data Mining?
So at least we saw four pattern families
which are commonly explored in
Spatial Data Mining, and we also talked
about things which are not spacial, you
know, data mining, and with that,
hopefully you have got a good feel
for the motivation as well as the basic
intuitive idea about spacial data mining.
So we will wrap up you know the discussion
of the first video here.
You may want to try a quiz to review your
knowledge.
When we come back in the next video, we
will look at, you know, the
spatial data quick time, just to, you know
have a quick review, you know, if
you, haven't seen the spatial equating
discussion
recently, and then we'll follow it with
[INAUDIBLE]
spatial statistical foundations and then
start going
into the deft of each pack and family.
So thank you, I look forward to seeing you
in the next video.
