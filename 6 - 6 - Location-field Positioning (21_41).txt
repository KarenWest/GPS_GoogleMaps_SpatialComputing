Howdy, folks.
Welcome back to the Positioning Module.
Today we're going to be talking
about location fields and
user profiles and
their role in content-based positioning.
Location fields positioning is
a commonly used approach for
finding the location
of a user of a system.
And like other content based
positioning approaches,
location field positioning is typically
employed when no GPS, Wi-Fi, or
cellular positioning
information is available.
This can happen if you're not
the owner of the system, for in,
that system that you're seeking to study,
or for instance, to build off.
For instance, when you're a, researcher or
say, any analyst trying
to locate a Twitter user.
And this can also occur if the user has
denied access to her location services for
your app on her mobile device as we
saw in Module five as well as for
a number of other reasons.
Location field positioning begins of
course with location fields most of
you are probably quite
familiar with location fields.
These fields exist in the vast
majority of online communities.
So, for example,
here we have the text I put in to
our MOOC's Twitter account location field,
here in the account's profile.
Here is me entering text in to
my location field on Facebook.
And then here's how that text shows
up on my, user profile on Facebook.
Here's a, a Pinterest user profile
location field and so on and so forth.
Basically all online communities
have one of these location fields.
Sometimes it's a drop-down menu,
sometimes there are more than one
location fields, and so on and
so forth, but some semblance of
a location field is nearly always there.
As a result, location fields can be
a valuable way to get a position for
the billions of members of online
communities that use some semblance of
a location field.
Now, in this video we're going to,
first learn how to use location
field to position users.
Then we're going to go
over the advantages and
disadvantages of location
field positioning.
And I assure you,
this, this, section in particular is
going to be a very entertaining topic.
And finally, we're going to close our
video and actually our discussion of
positioning in general, by connecting what
we have learned about location fields.
To frame a brief overview of what are
called location inference attacks as well
as a brief discussion of privacy and
location of our system.
Okay.
So let's talk about the how.
Now, just like was
the case with geoparsing,
location field positioning
requires taking a toponym which is
again the fancy way to say place name and
turning this
toponym into a machine readable
representation of the reference location.
So for example this would involve taking
the toponym Minneapolis, Minnesota.
And turning it into, for
instance, a latitude and
longitude coordinate representation
of Minneapolis, as you can see here.
Now this process is known as geocoding and
can be accomplished through
something called a geo-coder, like for
instance Google Geocoding API right here.
There are lots of other
web-based geocoding APIs, for
instance Microsoft has one through
its Bing API So does MapQuest.
There's the MapQuest geocoding API,
as well as Yahoo Yahoo BOSS Geo Services
that includes a geocoding API as well.
Now, in general, the way these
geocoding APIs work is you, you pass in
a string that contains a topineme, say,
for instance, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
And then you get back a result with lots
of information, including a latitude and
longitude coordinate for the toponym.
The string you type in doesn't have
to be just the name of the city.
It can also be a state a country,
or even a street address.
Now the latitude/longitude coordinate
returned by the Geocoder can, in some
cases, be used as an effective position
for a user for a number of applications
ranging from the simple mapping of users
to the geographic sentiment analysis of
users content, that we saw in
module five and so on and so forth.
Well this geocoating based location
field positioning pipeline is pretty
straight forward at a high level,
I'm hopeful that our discussion of
the pipeline has raised
a few questions for you.
So for instance, I just mentioned that
the lat long coordinates returned by
geocoding can be used in some cases but
not all.
What did I mean by that?
Also, if you watch the geoparsing
video which was the last video, you
should also probably, probably be thinking
about the issues of geo/geo ambiguity.
What happens when a user inputs into
her location field a toponym that
refers to more than one place?
We're going to address these and
a few other questions in
the second part of the video.
And for the second part of the video,
we're going to use the pros and
cons framework for module five.
I'm going to switch things up a bit and
start out with a con and so
let's talk about the first con
of location field positioning.
Which is really pretty simple,
it's that many people just don't
fill out the location fields
in their user profiles.
So for instance my colleague, Doctor who's
the leader of Wiki brain development.
Those of you in the technical track
know all about Wiki brain at this point.
Doctor Sen hasn't filled out
his Twitter location field and
neither has Colin Kaepernick, the
quarterback for the San Fransisco 49er's.
And I just noticed that even my fiance
hasn't filled out her location field,
even though she's the fiance of
a spatial computing professor.
I also noticed that many of the students
in this MOOC who were following
the MOOC's Twitter account haven't filled
out their location felds, fields as well.
Now overall, in a study in 2011,
my colleagues and I found that 18%
of Twitter users had nothing at all
entered in to their location fields.
Now there are lots of reasons for
not filling out the location field,
ranging from privacy concerns to
simply forgetting to fill it out.
But the practical, the practical effect
for those of us who build spacial
computing systems and do spacial
computing research is the same, right?
When there's no location field entry,
there's nothing to put in the geocoder,
which means there's no way to
do location field positioning.
Okay, time for the second con
of location field positioning.
Even when people do input information,
they often don't input this information at
a local enough scale for
many applications.
So for instance Dr. Vitak,
who we discussed earlier in the module,
has only input the state of Maryland
in her Twitter location field.
Now you folks do this as well,
for instance, a Kiri,
a follower of the MOOC Twitter account has
in put the exact same thing as Dr. Vitak.
Kiri and Dr.
Vitak are definitely not alone in
disclosing locations at a coarse scale.
In the same 2011 study, my colleagues and
I found that while the majority of
Twitter location field entries were at
the city scale, a non trivial minority of
these entries were at a coarser scale.
And this includes the many Twitter
users who, like Dr. Vitak and Dr.
and Kiri,
have input a state level location.
For many applications, a state level
position is simply insufficient and
this can render location,
field based positioning much less useful.
Another thing to look out for
in this context is something
called the geoweb scale problem.
And to understand
the geoweb scale problem,
let's return to the slide where we
were talking about how geocoders work.
Now the information most developers
pay attention to when they use
these geocoders is just the latitude and
longitude coordinate for the toponym they
generally ignore the other information.
Now, if you're entering
a street address like for
instance 200 Union St. SE, Minneapolis,
MN, this happens to be the address of
the Computer Science Department,
here at the University of Minnesota.
This is in general not a problem right?
A latitude and longitude coordinate
is a decent representation for
most applications of a street address.
The same is generally true of city
names like Minneapolis, Minnesota for
many applications.
However, once you get to the state
level on courser toponym a latitude and
longitude coordinate becomes less and
less useful.
So for instance this latitude and
longitude coordinate which is for
the toponym Alaska is the center
of the bounding box of Alaska.
Now, the real danger occurs here,
when developers carelessly use
these course latitude and longitude
coordinate representations, thinking that
they're much more local representations.
And they use these as inputs
into a geographic analysis or
application pipeline, and let me tell you,
this happens all the time.
So for instance to give you a very simple
example let's say I'm building a spatial
computing system, or doing some sort of
spatial computing in a Linux project and
I want to know how far away
all uses of another system,
say we're building our system,
we're doing our analysis on this system.
How far way the users of this
system are from Anchorage, Alaska.
And to do this I carelessly use a geocoder
base location field positioning process.
If I did this, anyone who enters Alaska
into their, into their location field, and
many users do, for these users
I would mistakenly believe that
these users are 400 kilometers away from
Anchorage which is of course incorrect,
because Anchorage is inside Alaska.
And actually the distance
in this case is undefined.
More generally, the geoweb scale problem
can be defined to occur when latitude and
longitude coordinates,
which are really the foundation of spatial
representations on the geoweb,
and when latitude and
longitude coordinates are not
appropriate for the desired scale of
a given spatial computing research project
or a spacial computing application.
Now this term geoweb is kind of a catch
all in the geography and geographing
information science communities for topics
like VGI, geo-tagging and web mapping.
But these days I'm generally tending
away from this term because we
have these specific terms like VGI.
Although we do still have
the geoweb scale problem here.
Fortunately, most geocoders will
provide you with easy ways to
determine if the lat long return is going
to present geoweb scale problems for
applications that
are more local in nature.
Now so for instance the Google geocoding
API here provides two hints of
this in the object it returns
to the toponym Alaska.
You can see it's telling us that the type
is an administrative area, rather than for
instance an address.
And the location type part
here is approximate, right?
That's a big flag.
So from a technical perspective, handling
the geoweb scale problem really isn't
that hard at all thanks in, thanks to
these hints that geocoders give you.
And in fact I would say from
a technical perspective,
handling a geoweb scale problem
is actually really easy.
The key is recognizing that many of the
locations you encounter in location field
positioning and quite frankly in other
content based positioning approaches as
well are going to be loc,
excuse me, multi-scalar, right?
They're going to be at the city level,
they're going,
going to be at the state level.
And so you really can't blindly use
the lat long return by geocoders,
that's going to be highly problematic for
many applications.
Let's move on to the third disadvantage
of location field positioning.
And that is that many people enter
non-geographic information in
to their location fields.
Now on our study of the Twitter location
field, we found that about 16% of
Twitter location field entries
contained non-goegraphic information.
And what do I mean by non
geographic information?
Well, I mean things like this.
Loserville with God Middle-Earth,
and then a a popular
favorite when I present this research
back in 2011, Justin Bieber's heart.
And once again, these are the values that
Twitter users are entering into their
location fields.
And these are the values that are showing
up publicly in their user profiles.
More generally we saw a number of
categories in non-geographic information
and these are really fun.
Some of the more common categories
were popular cultural references.
So we already saw Justin Bieber's Heart.
There were a lot of references to Justin
Bieber's Heart in the location field in
fact I think around .5% of location field
entries that we randomly sampled had
some reference to Justin Bieber at that
time and when we did this study in 2010,
so we have BieberTown, PLZJustinFollowme,
this is Twitter's Global rights.
We also see, JaeJoongs heart and
we also see a personal favorite of
mine Schrute Farms, I'm a fan of
The Office, so that one got me chuckling.
We also saw a number of
references to privacy.
Like for
instance stalk Stalker kgb answers and for
me to know n u to find out.
And then lastly, we saw a number of
negative emotions towards people's current
locations, so they say things like,
preferably anywhere but
here, a hole in the ground swirling
in the abyss, and so on and so forth.
I'm from a small town, so
I can imagine when I was in high school,
I might have written something like that.
But now I,
I realize how lovely my small town is.
So, there are a number of
hazards associated with
non-geographing information
in location fields.
And probably the most important of
these hazards is that geocoders can be
much worse at geo,
non-geo ambiguity than geo parsers.
So for instance,
at the time we ran our study in 2010,
Yahoo's geocoder returned at least
one possible lat line coordinate for
over 80% of the non-geographic location.
Now geocoders have got, have gotten
a quite a bit better since then, but it's
important to keep an eye on this issue
when doing location field positioning,
just before I came in here to record I was
messing around with Google's geocoder.
It wasn't fooled too often by these
non geographic locations, but
it was fooled a few times.
Now, broadening or discussion here a bit,
the inability of geocoders to handle
geo/non geo and geo/geo ambiguity
is the final weakness of location field
positioning that I'm going to cover today.
Now the reason geocoders struggle with
ambiguity is that unlike geoparsers,
geocarders don't have the rich
textual context that we use to
disambiguate cases of
ambiguity like Washington.
So if someone just entered the topic
in Washington in their location field,
its much more difficult for
a geocoder to address both geo/geo
ambiguity and geo/non geo ambiguity.
And this basically means, right, we don't
know whether this Washington refers to
the, Washington, to Washington State,
to Washington D.C., to the University of
Washington or even to George Washington if
the person is a history buff or something.
So that's it for the cons.
Given how lopsided this screen is you may
be wondering why on earth anyone would
want to use Location Field Positioning.
Well, the first pro should answer
your question pretty directly.
Location field positioning
works when other options don't.
So, in other words, location field
positioning allows developers and
researchers to get a position for
users in cases where
other positioning techniques are much
harder to use or are impossible to use.
Now, this is such an important point
that I'm actually going to make that
font bigger so that we can visually
counteract it so that this,
this pro can visually counteract the the
cons as much as it does in real life.
Now we touched on why location
field positioning has this very
important advantage at
the beginning of this lecture.
But as a quick reminder let's say you
want to geotag tweets for the millions of
Twitter accounts that don't use geotagging
and you want to do this to include them in
some sort of spatial computing analysis or
spatial computing application.
Or maybe let's say you want to do
the same thing Instagram accounts that
don't geotag and so on and so forth.
Now in these cases pretty much are only
option besides an inference attack which
is something we'll talk about in a second.
Your only option in these cases is to
use the information from location field.
There's also another lesser known
advantage of location field
positioning and that is that location
fields contain information that is
at a different spatiotemporal resolution,
than most other position,
position information we
encounter in spatial computing.
Now in particular, while GPS and Wi-Fi and
cellular positioning give you up to the
second position information, and geotags
on social media give position information
at the exact time content was produced,
location field information can be an easy
way to determine where someone spends most
of their time or where they live, rather
than where they are at a specific moment.
And to understand what I mean let's say
we want to determine the home county of
the owner of this Twitter account @bhecht.
That's obviously my Twitter account and my
home county happens to be Hennepin County.
We'll see that more in a second here.
This type of thing determining the home
counties of users is done frequently in
practice, for instance, in public
health applications, market research,
academic research and so on and so forth.
And to be very clear here we don't want to
know where I am at, at any given time for
instance at the time I tweet.
We want to know where I live.
Now let's say we observe five
fictionalized tweets from
@bhecht these two from Hennepin County
here where I actually live.
So, Go Gophers!
Beat the Badgers!
And, doing some recording for
@Spatial CompMOOC, very meta there.
And let's say we also observe this tweet,
at dentist appointment #toothfail.
This is at Ramsey county, right next
store, where my dentist, actually,
happens to be.
And we also observe this tweet, OMG!
Just drove on a lake it's it's cold.
Now I did actually happen to
drive on a lake this, pas,
past winter in Bayfield County up there.
It was, as someone who was born and
raised in California and
saw snow all of three times before I
first moved to Minnesota this was one
of the coolest things I have ever done.
But I digress.
Let's return to our example here and
let's look at our fifth fictional tweet,
and this one.
#ah, headed to Amsterdam.
Ha headed to #Amsterdam, excuse me.
It's from Wayne County where
the Detroit airport happens to be.
So given all of these tweets from
all of these different counties,
in which county does the owner
of @Bhecht actually live?
Well there's all sorts
of data driven ways and
fancy ways to infer home counties,
but there's also a much easier way.
And that is just to use the entry
in the location field, right?
Of course to do this you have to
be sure that the disadvantages I
talked about earlier,
don't apply to your project or that you've
already taken advantage of them, but for
many applications for home locations.
Just using the location field
is definitely sufficient.
Okay, so the last subject we're
going to cover in this video, and
the last subject we're going to cover
actually in this entire module.
Is we're going to briefly talk
about location inference attacks.
And to understand location
inference attacks,
lets consider a hypothetical
Twitter account here, @geoprivacy.
And this belongs to a person who is
very privacy conscious with respect to
her position information and
other personal data.
You can see that this
person has participated in
the surprisingly common practice
of using the location field to
express her privacy value with
regard to position information.
This person of course hasn't
geo tagged any tweets at all.
And let's pause here for
a second and think about whether or
not @privacy has succeeded at
protecting her position information.
From say marketers who want to figure
out where she is or for instance in
other cases government agencies that
might want to do the same thing.
Now as you might have guessed here
the answer is definitely not.
@geoprivacy has revealed
tons of implicit and
explicit position information,
in the content of her tweets themselves.
Now, as a result
@geoprivacy can be easily,
easily locating using actually
relatively straightforward algorithms.
To understand this let's walk through
a few examples of what I mean by
explicit and implicit information starting
with this text here local wild rice.
Wild rice is more common in
some regions than in others.
And one region in which wild rice is
quite common is here in Minnesota.
This information is substantiated by
the fact that, @geoprivacy here has
mentioned Lunds which happens to be
a local, supermarket, to the Twin Cities.
And there's also a Snickers-on-a-stick
at the fair and a youbetcha.
Snickers-on-a-stick are a,
it's a common food people eat here at
the Minnesota State Fair
at the end of the summer.
And then you betcha is a common
Minnesotan expression.
Gophers, that's a that's
our team mascot right.
So go gophers.
this, as you'll prolly see is
happily they won last night.
And then cheese curds are a common
food here in Minnesota.
Some, so reading this as either a human or
as an algorithm,
it's pretty easy to tell that this
person is here in the Twin Cities.
Now, because of all this explicit and
implicit geographying information,
a really straightforward
algorithm is related to and
actually including geo parsing, can
easily infer a position for, for geo, for
geo privacy, as I mentioning earlier at
least low spacial temporo resolution.
So some colleagues and
I did some of the first work using
algorithms for this type of application.
And we were able to predict the location
of Twitter users at the country level
using a subset of countries at a pretty
high accuracy, at,at a 89% accuracy.
At the state level,
we were less accurate but
still still significantly more
accurate than a, than random guessing.
We got Twitter users in the United States.
We go the correct state 30% of the time.
Now since we did this work a lot
of folks have followed up on it.
And these accuracy levels
have really been blown out of
the water by other researchers.
And one technique they've used which
has been particularly powerful is,
is to take advantage of
social network information.
So you can see here that @geoprivacy
is following the current which is a,
Twin Cities radio station.
And the Minnesota State Fair,
which is the Twitter account for
the, state fair I was
talking about a second ago.
Using this information, right,
just, just intuitively speaking.
And algorithms can do this very easily.
It's pretty straightforward
to determine right here,
right, that @geoprivacy is
local here to the Twin Cities.
And this, of course, can be combined with
the content-oriented approaches looking at
the tweets, and you get a pretty strong
signal @geoprivacy is a, a Twin Cities
local, even though she doesn't geo-tag her
tweets, and she hasn't entered anything.
Any sort of geographing information
into her location field.
So the fact that your location
can be easily inferred even if
you're as privacy
conscious as @geoprivacy.
This is a major concern and when that
is occurring beyond spatial computing,
beyond computer science, beyond geography.
It's one that's occurring
at a societal level.
Many people consider the specific of their
location extremely sensitive personal
information I'm one of these people.
And as it stands, thanks to both signal
based and content based positioning.
This information is often in
the hands of numerous companies and
institutions, a many of which that,
many of which actually haven't directly
interacted with the person about whom
they have collected position information.
Location privacy is a major topic and
outside the scope of this particular MOOC.
But if you're interested I highly
recommend that you watch this speech by
Al Franken, who's one of the two
senators from the state of Minnesota.
It's a powerful speech and actually one
that very elegantly addresses the need for
regulation or other solutions to
the invasion of location privacy.
That is the downside of the many
positioning technologies we've
covered in this video.
Okay, that is it for this video I
hope you've enjoyed learning about
positioning and
I'll see you in the next module.
