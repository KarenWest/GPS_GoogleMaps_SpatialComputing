Welcome back to the discussion
of spatial computing.
In next couple of videos,
we are going to do two things.
First, we'll try to define spatial
computing via a set of common questions.
And then in another short video, we'll
talk about who uses spatial computing,
who are the customers and so on.
Okay.
So that would be the second one,
all right.
So in terms of thinking about the core
questions in spatial computing
a central question, you know, which has
centuries of history, is where am I?
People who navigate in open spaces
often have to answer this question.
In fact about 400 years ago,
the ships crossing Atlantic Ocean from
Europe on way to, you know, commerce.
Often had to ask this question, and
it was another challenging question.
They could look at the position of sun or
stars to determine roughly their latitude.
However, the longitude was very hard to
determine and there was a grand prize,
you know, there was a really,
really large financial reward for
people to invent equipment to
find the longitude of ships.
And several different inventors over
decades invented these things and
we still benefit from some of those.
In fact, the clocks which could work
in the ocean with all this you know,
motion came out of this in,
in a particular quest.
More recently we are really lucky
to have global positioning system.
Many of use that through smartphone or
other devices to locate ourselves.
Okay.
Another interesting question
is what's around us?
The context.
In geography, people have mapped out many,
many features and properties of the Earth,
including many consumer relevant features,
such as clinics or
gas stations, or
automatic teller machines, and so on.
So again, via smartphone many of
us have probably tried this out.
And if you,
once you know your location, you can ask,
where is the nearest Pizza Hut?
Or gas station and so on.
Okay.
And once, you know,
these are now offered through something
called location-based services.
And in this course, we'll come and
look under the hood to see what are the
computational concepts underlying those.
Okay.
A third question is situation assessment.
Okay.
This is something which is really used
often by companies and by government.
So whenever there is,
is a fluid situation, so
try to imagine the aftermath of
hurricane Katrina, or hurricane Rita.
Right?
Or a tornado.
The insurance companies and the
government, they want to find, you know,
where people are who need the help,
you know, and so on.
And often times,
that information is represented to a map.
And and there a different kinds
of questions we ask, you know,
one, we basically want to
know where things are and
how they're distributed,
which area has a concentrate,
a concentration of people, which can
need a help, and that's just mapping.
They may fly an airplane or
a UAV take satellite imagery, have
geographers digitized and interpret it,
and just create a map, you know,
every day to see how things are changing.
Okay.
Sometimes we also summarize those maps and
we instead of looking at all areas of map,
we may have to prioritize.
So we may look for hot spots of people and
try to, you know, send larger help there.
Okay.
Again we'll dedicate a week in this course
to understand the spatial patterns and
statistical foundations underlying those.
So continuing on people are also
interested in temporal evaluation.
Sometimes situation changes a lot,
from day to day or hour to hour.
For example, here we are showing you
an animation of crime reports in
Amsterdam by the hour of the day and
as you can see,
the crime pattern changes from night
to rush hour to day and so on, and
this is of help to police and other
people working with crime to manage that.
Okay.
So again, we pull you know, people do
either through the days or over centuries.
You know, another example of this is
climate change, which is at much larger
scale, but people are feeling that over
centuries or over tens of thousands of
years that climate changes dramatically
and that it effects human civilization.
So again, through different topics we
will see these questions addressed in
this course.
And finally geography and
spatial data is used for
a lot of exploration, you know,
which may be basis of science.
Okay.
For example, you know, we might want to
know whether our schools are safe or not.
And people often collect a lot of
data about environmental quality.
The air quality, water quality,
they want to know where the hot spots are,
and are they effecting critical
things like schools and so on.
Okay.
People often generate hypothesis and
we'll talk about a, a very interesting
hypothesis that was generated out of maps,
related to spread of You know,
back in 1800s people thought
cholera was spread through air.
You know,
they use to have this bad air theory.
And the doctors used to wear beaks,
you know,
on their nose full of spices to
protect themselves from air.
And in about 1854, John Snow made a map
of London after a cholera epidemic.
And he showed that the locations
of debts of people,
they were all around the water pump, and
this change the hypothesis saying that
maybe there is something in the water that
cause, you know, that carrier cholera.
20 years later germ theory came and
it's a major evolution in science.
So again, you know, these are the other
question and you can, you know,
this kind of hypothesis generation can
be supported either through databases.
What we are calling SDBMS,
Spatial Database Management System,
where people can go into what is query,
or they could be supported through
explorative data analysis of statistical
of nature where you do find hot spots.
Okay.
Great.
So with this, you know,
we hope we gave you a sense
of some example questions in
the field of spatial computing.
And, you know, in the following weeks,
you will probably see these questions in
much more detail along with the techniques
that have been developed so far.
And hopefully as time goes by,
you will add to this list of question and
as well as to the techniques
that can be used to answer them.
So we'll wrap up this video over here.
Next video we'll come back and
talk about the customers,
who are the users who ask these kind of
questions in, in today or in recent years.
Thank you.
