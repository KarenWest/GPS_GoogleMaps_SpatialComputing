So looking ahead next,
five to seven years.
>> What do you think will be the biggest
development in spatial computing?
>> What do you see as the future
of GIS and spatial computing?
>> Where do you think this field is going?
What do you think will be the biggest
development in spatial computing?
>> What do you think is
the future of spatial computing?
I think the most interesting thing
in special committees is there's no
one thing that's future directional.
You know, if it's just one thing,
it would be very [INAUDIBLE] but
now it becomes kind of an ecosystem.
So what I always see here.
This is real stuff if you
want to do applications.
You know, there's lots of people
in geography and GIS domain.
There are a lot of applications.
So geographic data and
analysis, that's a huge thing.
However, you can go lower in the stick.
Lower in the stick if you,
very low in the stick like,
what will inform a producer environment,
supporting big special data.
In between this tool, which is,
you know using as their visualization
even just kind of the managing vehicle
to vehicle there are many things here,
so it's kind of an equal system thing.
Not to define one thing.
>> Wonderful.
>> And then I think the difference
between special computing now and
special computing ten or 15 years ago.
>> Huh.
>> Ten or
15 years ago there were very few people
actually addressing different issues other
than applications.
Now it's more of an ecosystem thing.
>> I think when, when I think about it.
In a very very generic way.
I think, like, you know to, to go more on.
To, to kind of, like, expand more
on this changing graph paradigm.
People are collecting data everywhere.
And, you know, like, you know?
If you use you know,
an online navigation system.
Like, and everybody's, like, saying that,
okay, fine, don't take this road,
because it's congested.
And, you know, like,
this is the travel time.
And, you know?
So, and, and big companies like na,
Nokia is, like, putting data out there,
so that is a lot of data coming in.
>> Okay.
>> And so we need to somehow
incorporate this into our computations
to make computations more meaningful.
>> Okay.
>> And so
I think we need to have a mechanism to
somehow use this data meaningfully, but
at the same time, it's the volume is
like growing, like, so drastically.
So we need to somehow make
the computations efficient, so
I think big data is here.
You know, so that.
I think that, that is going to sort of,
like, creep in everywhere.
So we need to explore that.
And how we can actually incorporate.
The big data analytics internet work
computation which is not that easy.
>> Okay.
>> Because networks are not
that easily partitioned.
>> Okay.
>> Insensibly.
So we need to figure out how to
partition networks so you know?
Sensible so that we don't have too much
communication going on between the nodes.
>> Okay.
>> And
also that we don't sacrifice too much of.
Accuracy.
>> Yeah, okay.
>> Mining is a different issue.
Because I think mining, you know,
as long you find out the trends it's okay.
But with networks I know it's,
it's still a tough problem.
How to-
>> Harder.
>> That.
So, and then also like we need
to adapt our algorithms also to
suit this big data paradigm.
We need to figure out how to do that.
And even if we don't move into that, you
know, as the volume of the data increases.
It is basically, and
also even, just bringing in time
kind of complicated everything.
>> Explored the,
the data volume, right, for
each instance you may have
a replication of the network, right?
>> Yeah, yeah.
And so, it is basically, I also like we
cannot apply the old algorithm techniques.
>> Okay, Okay.
>> And most of the assumptions that
we made with respect to the old
algorithm design, cannot be applied
when time comes in because most of
the properties that we relied on to
apply these techniques are breaking.
>> Right.
>> And, for example, I cannot use
a dynamic program to find the best
shortest path [INAUDIBLE] to answer
the question, than to start.
>> Oh, wow.
So we did,
you know,
we did talk about Dijkstra and A-stars.
>> Yes.
>> So what happens to
those when you add time?
>> Because Dijkstra basically depends
on a property called greedy property,
which actually depends on
a sub-optimal structure, you know,
of the final solution, which breaks when.
When we actually extend the shortest
path question to when is
the best time to start, so
that I spend the least time on the road?
You know so we are actually talking about
optimizing it across on the graph and
across time too so
when that comes in the property doesn't,
is not satisfied anymore so
I cannot extend Dijkstra easily.
>> You know that's,
that's a really tough question.
I guess there's a few things that I
think will be really important and
I think they,
again I'm going to focus more on
the widespread adoption
of certain technologies.
So again, for a long time people have been
talking about the Internet of things.
Things that are computationally,
objects in the real world that
are computationally they're hooked
into the computational world.
They have maybe active transmitters or
passive sensors, so
that we know their location.
I mean, the obvious example, people lose
their keys, they forget where objects are.
Up to inventory management where you
want to know what objects exist or
what objects you have in stock,
what objects you don't.
And even in your refrigerator,
you want to know what you're out of,
what you need to get.
again, ideas that have been around.
The technology there exists in some
prototype forms and in some places
being deployed, but it's not widespread,
I think that's going to be a huge thing.
I think another humble
thing is battery power,
you know, if we all have our phones.
But the location sensing
technology drains batteries.
>> I guess
>> And charging batteries is a huge
problem, and
there's talk about batteries that
are going to last days instead of hours.
I think this is going to make
a big difference as we want to
hook all the world into
the computational world.
The physical world into the computational
world including knowing locations
of things.
And I think that's going to be really
important, we need better battery
technology and
processors that draw less power.
And then I think the thing that I don't
quite know how we're going to do this.
But as we do that.
The privacy challenges are going
to become massively greater.
Even than they are today.
When the whole world is aware,
the whole physical world is part of
the computational infrastructure.
The world knows where you are, and
what you've been in proximity to and
who you've been in proximity to.
There's going to be a chance for
great services, but
how are we going to avoid ubiquitous
nagging, ubiquitous advertisements,
and ubiquitous surveillance, and
yet still get benefits from it.
So I think as we move
forward the opportunity from
just wide spread you know?
Computational awareness of objects
is going to be great, and yet
the challenges that poses are going to
have to be addressed through a combination
of, you know, technical and social and
policy innovations as we move forward.
>> I think it I, my specialty is the GIS,
and especially the algorithms and
the joins and then but my group is
the learning to data mining algorithms.
>> Okay.
>> So
the first three years we do some modeling
and algorithms about the special joins.
Then next three years, we spend most of
the time on data mining tools and limit.
>> They are wonderful.
Wonderful.
You mentioned exposome.
What is that, and what is its future.
>> Exposome is the study of the effect of
environmental factors on human health.
So it could be very short time period for
example, asthma, you
patient exposed, in essence, like a smoker
cigarette smoker and they got attacked.
>> Yeah.
>> Or exposure could be like,
a very you know,
long life period which is the cancer.
>> Hmm.
>> So, different time intervals will you
know, patients monitoring are required
and just started in 2006.
This quite new field.
And there is a lot of
problems over measurement and
in the modeling and algorithms.
>> Yes wonderful.
And when, you know last question.
Most of us are used to having GPS on
smart phones and the cars and so on.
But your group and
your neighbor in asthma policy.
They were putting GPS on
inhalers used by asthma patients.
>> Right, right.
>> So, do you see more use of GPS with
sensors to monitor personal health and
environmental health in coming years?
>> Right.
So, asthma patients
recommended to carry inhalers.
And also they use the peak
flow labor gauge everyday.
Those two are the main achromatic
photos that patients need to carry.
>> Okay.
>> And so we developed in a sensors.
>> Okay.
>> That is very like a tiny,
tiny microprocessor that
is built in an inhaler.
This is a kind of inhaler.
The U.S. and U.A. patients use.
>> Right.
>> So we developed a small cap that
actually come with this inhaler.
Whenever the patients pushes the inhaler
button we measure the time and location,
and also the how long it actually pressed,
so that doctors know
in the patients is
properly used in as well.
So it can be used to the analysis of the,
you know,
location and time, export your time.
At the same time, it can be used to,
for the patient's training.
>> Yeah, okay.
Wonderful.
>> And this data is going to
be transported, you know,
user's, the patient's mobile phone
>> Okay.
>> and then we store this one in
the secure server so there for
the, you know, data analysis later.
>> Yeah, wonderful.
So personal health may be a big area for
spatial computing.
Right, [CROSSTALK] it's,.
>> Unequal farmers.
>> Yeah.
In a weak world, this is an individual
account you know, [CROSSTALK] health care.
>> Health care.
Okay.
>> So
most of the doctors that are currently
in surgeon and medical fields do that.
They use the average
of this sign on there,
some of the symptoms average out with
their idea, temperature and so on.
Okay.
>> And
more likely people do it, the reaction.
There are symptoms could vary
based on the individual symptoms.
So, this is the, what we want to do,
provide the individual the care of
[INAUDIBLE] has these symptoms.
>> So, let me, let me just mention, too,
because I think there are a lot of them.
But I think two would be a good start
first this idea of engaging the citizen
with geographic information.
I mentioned that it's having
profound effects, and
I think those effects have
still to play themselves out.
And when we talk about VGI, we usually
think of a project like open street map.
Where people are helping to create
a map of the world by using
their own GPS, or their own cell phone,
or what have you.
But that's using people
to produce something that
has been traditionally part of our lives.
And what, what is really different is when
you say, what are people really good at?
What kinds of geographic information
do they really harbor in their heads?
And it's not information
about latitude and
longitude, it's information about places.
And so I'm trying to explore the whole
possibility of developing technology
not around coordinates, and
around space but around named places.
Features on the earth's surface.
People have huge repositories
of information about places.
I, you know that Seattle
is known as a rainy place.
>> Right.
[LAUGH].
>> That piece of knowledge
doesn't fit within any GIS, and
yet that sort of knowledge
is enormously valuable.
And we have huge resources of
that knowledge in the human mind.
So I'm interested in exploring in how we
can release that knowledge and share it.
So that's one.
The second one is that we sometimes
refer to GIS technology as the 83%.
I see.
[LAUGH]
>> The 17.
Let me put it the other way.
The 17% technology.
Because the average human spends seven,
only 17% of their lives outdoors and
83% of their lives indoors.
And so I'm very interested in the
possibility of an indoor version of GIS.
>> Great.
>> As GIS helps you navigate outdoors,
I think it'll,
should also help us navigate indoors.
Believe it or not,
there are actually people in this
world who get lost in their own homes.
[LAUGH] All of us get lost in large
shopping centers, in complex airports,
and yet
our GIS technology doesn't work there.
And doesn't give us very effective help.
>> Wonderful.
>> So I think one very definite
growth direction is indoor GIS.
Geared towards the 83% of our time that
we spend indoors rather than
the 17% that we spend outdoors.
>> Well it's always hard to predict and
two to five years is not very long.
So I would not expect like, dramatic
changes in the next two to five years.
Maybe in ten to 15 years but
not in two the, two to five years.
I would assume though that we will end up
with, from a mobile computing perspective,
with much more useful apps.
In terms of if you look at some of the
problems that we're facing now with you
know you name them Climate Change, energy,
resources, I think there's a potential
to use a lot of apps and sensors in order
to steer people towards better behavior.
So I'm thinking of, for example,
an app that tracks your behavior in terms,
in terms of energy efficiency and
provides recommendations.
How you can do better or
how your energy behavior compares to
other people like going a little
bit into the geo gaming area that's
where many things I think can
be improved and will improve.
So this is what I would expect for
the years to come for
the next couple years to come.
>> So then you,
you actually anticipated my next question.
What do you think about the next
ten to 15 years you know
when you're an old man I'm middle aged?
[LAUGH].
>> I, I'll still consider
myself middle aged then.
[LAUGH].
>> So we'll be, both be middle aged men.
[LAUGH].
>> Ten to 15 years.
Well I'm, I'm giving you some ideas from,
from my research perspective of course.
But having been working with all
this mobile eye tracking and,
and new interaction devices,
and Google Glass and
stuff like that, I think,
in the next ten to 15 years,
I'm pretty sure that we can expect
some brand new interaction modes.
So, I mean, if I had to forecast, I would
say that more, more people will be using,
maybe not Google Glass, but,
you know, similar devices.
And I personally think at that
time every mobile phone will
have an iTracker integrated.
So, you can actually use
your eyes to you know,
do simple things like click on boxes and
stuff like that, but also that the,
the system actually will,
will record your face patterns.
And based on the patterns, extract or get
some information about what you want to do
with the device, and maybe be supportive
in supporting you during the spatial,
temporal tasks that you're doing.
So I think more interaction,
more activity recognition from the system.
Based on you know new technology such
as eye trackers which nowadays are not
really, I mean not even the Google Glass
you have an eye tracker integrated, but
I think that's a very
useful interaction mold and
of course other molds will improve too
like audio communication to many people.
Already working on hands
free navigation systems and
I'm pretty sure we'll have most of
that stuff ready in ten to 15 years.
>> One that I kind of see popping
up is these analytics that
are tailored towards very specific domain.
And an example would be taking traditional
analytic techniques such as hotspots and
tailoring them to road networks or
to arbitrary shapes,
rings, polygons, different types of
things that suit particular domains.
So this is sort of another angle that
actually is is, is coming in the future.
>> It, it's very hard to predict.
But you know if,
if we take Google Earth right?
And now we have tons of,
tons of basic geo-information available.
Of course, you know,
this information needs to be up to date.
I think, you know, this is a challenge
because, you know, the data we need to
handle and the datasets are getting
more and more complex over time.
And with that challenge, we add more and
more extra, or
so-called meta information, to that data.
And, of course, same there,
you know, with meta information.
We, we need to you know, we need to
keep that data sets up to date, right.
We, we don't really, we just we need, we
want to know okay, here's the supermarket.
But of course we also want to know, okay,
here you know this is the opening
hours at the URL and this needs to
be really updated all all the time so
all the [INAUDIBLE] information.
Needs to be updated constantly, and
it also need to be coherent
with other information.
So the relationships between the data
cells, between the meta-information
the semantics, they also need
to be worked, worked out well.
I think this is a very,
very challenging project that will keep us
busy in the next two to five years.
With that, I think you know,
this is like behind the screen.
But with that, because we had more and
more information, it's also, you know,
challenging how to adapt the interfaces
to allow people to explore
all this additional meta information that
is beyond the pure spatial information.
So we have just seen the method for like
it was a major redesign of Google maps,
and with pros and cons, I guess it
will also be discussed in the coursed.
But you know, it's, it's not just that we
need to keep that information updated,
we also need to adapt the UI,
the user interface and
allow people to explore you know,
the benefits of the extra information.
I think that's you know,
maybe the challenges not YouTube.
Five years, then, you know, ten to 15
years, very very hard to, to predict,
but, you know, this is what I learned
in my first lesson at the university.
I, I heard the phrase that 80%
of all decisions in politics.
And economy have a spatial component.
And I think, you know, it,
it's, it may well increase.
So the importance of
spatial information for
a variety of disciplines and a variety
of decisions will, will increase.
And I guess we will, we will notice that,
like, in ten, 15 years.
So that, a lot of things.
Are based on, on, on spatial data.
But, you know, it's,
it's hard to really predict what,
what will go on what will,
what will go on in ten, 15 years.
>> For Minnesota again it's,
it's expanding to I think
all disciplines on campus.
we're, we're certainly growing in
some of the big data needs and
those types of products.
Projects but it's mostly other
disciplines picking it up, and
working collaboratively
between multiple departments.
>> Won, wonderful.
So, you know,
I have interesting analogy you know,
and I was in undergraduate school earlier
many campuses had a computer center which
was a shared resource.
>> Mm-hm.
>> People who wanted to
use big computing would come there for
help.
And then it slowly grew into a graduate
program, and then departments, and
now it's a very, very vibrant
discipline [LAUGH] with large industry.
>> Yeah.
>> Do you see similar analogy with
GIS Service Center that them do
you see this pre cursor to becoming
you know bigger things on campus?
>> I, I do I think it, I think it will,
I think that there's the idea of
this spatial university where you
integrate GIS remote sensing.
Throughout much of the university and
it will continue to grow and in a way we
make use of a lot of other resources,
such as the supercomputing center and
other resources to do that.
>> If you look at all the major
problems facing society,
food security, water security, energy.
They all involve solutions that would
require big role being played the spatial
computing, because most of these problems
involve data that are spatial in nature.
You know, that goes with agriculture,
with food, with water, with energy.
And being able to understand these
data sets and how they interplay,
what is the interplay between food,
water, and energy you really need to
involved spatial computing technologies
to be able to answer this.
So I expect special computing to play
a major role in advancing the major
interests of the society as we go forward
>> Okay, wonderful.
But is it just an application of well
known computer science technique,
could you just take your classical
data mining technique and
run those on spacial later,
will that do the job?
Or do you need new computer science here?
>> New computer science here,
that's a very good question, and
I often tell when I, I show what
we're working on to, to the audience.
To the student, and I often remind
them that, here is a problem.
If you, if you use textbook techniques,
how far you can,
can take these problems, and
what you need, in addition, to go beyond.
And I'll give you an example of
something we just talked about earlier,
of which was the detection of fire.
And, and, and
you saw that the we are able to sort of
identify locations of fires on the globe.
We are able to identify locations
of insect damage on the globe using
that analysis.
Now if you tried to work on these
problems using traditional techniques,
you face a number of challenges.
And yes these data search happen to be
the, the events that you're looking for
happen to be extremely rare to the extent
that most locations thankfully,
do not burn all the time.
They, they, they burn very rarely.
The other problem is that you
do not have ground troops for
most of these of in California
they track fires very carefully.
But if you're looking at Siberian forest
there's hardly ground showed there.
So if you want to do global coverage
about what these events are,
you have to build models that
are work in absence of ground showed,
that can work with highly
skewed data search.
They can take advantage of
the special nature of the data and
the tire, temporal nature of the of
the phenomena, and most of the classical
techniques that we discuss in our
books and data mining courses.
They're not incorporated for
these special needs.
So there's a tremendous need for, for
novel techniques to be developed
in the area of spatial computing.
