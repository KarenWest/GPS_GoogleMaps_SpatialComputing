Hi folks,
welcome back to the cartography module.
In this video, we're going to target
our third learning objective,
which is to know the limitations
of popular online and
mobile reference maps, like Google Maps,
Apple Maps, Bing Maps, and so on.
Using the technical track,
we will be learning how to address some of
these limitations in your assignment this
week, which we'll cover in another video.
Now you've noticed that this learning
objective is phrased somewhat negatively,
knowing the limitations of
popular online and mobile maps.
The reason this is the case,
is that you probably are,
are already quite aware of
the benefits of these technologies.
So recall that the high level
geocommunication goal of reference maps,
is to help the map user to understand
the location of specific entities, and
that people use reference maps
primarily for orientation and
navigation with respect to
these specific entities.
So, for the majority of reference
map use cases, Google Maps and
it's competitors do
really an amazing job and
in fact, in all of human history, I think
we've never had reference maps this good.
So for example, prior to Google Maps and
it's competitors, if I wanted a reference
map that for instance shows me all
the Japanese restaurants near Berkeley,
California, I would have had to spend a
great deal of time using a phone book and
either a paper map or
a geographic information system to
make my own custom reference map.
Now these days,
I can just query Google Maps and voila.
I'm sure you guys have done this many,
many times.
Now in addition, if I want to get a map
that shows me how to get to one of
these restaurants, right?
Remember that navigation is another
important high level use case of
reference maps,
you can do that just as easily.
Even in some reference map use cases
where normal Google maps largely fails,
Google and other companies offer other
products that support these use cases.
So let's say, for instance, you want to
make a map of all the festivities going on
for a wedding celebration in Chicago,
Illinois.
Now you can make a webpage that lists out
all the addresses of where the wedding
ceremony is, where the wedding reception
is, where the hotels are and so on and so
forth, or you can make a custom map using
Google's My Maps, which is totally free.
Now using Google My Maps in just
a few moments I was able to turn
these addresses into a passable map to
put on, for instance, a wedding webpage.
And in fact you can actually even in
add in navigation instructions for
your wedding guests.
And of course, you don't really
need anything this fancy to
make this type of map.
For many use cases, it's really often
just sufficient to take a screenshot of
an online map and load it into Microsoft
Paint or some presentation software, and
point out the specific locations
you'd like folks to know about.
And while this often
doesn't look quite as nice,
a lot of the time it's just as useful.
I will note that you do have to pay
attention to the terms of service for
these maps if you're going to
do something like this.
And that's something we'll be
talking about in a little bit.
Okay.
So while Google Maps, Apple Maps, and
so on are fantastic,
they also have important limitations.
And my expectation is that you're much
less aware of these limitations than you
are of the benefits of these technologies.
What we're going to do for
the rest of this video is discuss
a number of these limitations.
Now knowing these limitations will
make you a more educated user of maps.
And if you're in the technical track,
it will set the stage for
your assignment, which will help you
become familiar with the tools you
need to make better reference maps for
certain use cases.
Okay, so let's get started with
limitation number one, here.
And that is that Google Maps, Apple Maps,
Bing Maps and so on, all have made
certain tradeoffs, that while they may
be optimal for important use cases,
they result in them communicating
inaccurate representations of the world.
The most famous example of this,
is that the Web Mercator projection has
become the defacto standard for
online and global maps.
Now we're not going to go into detail
about map projections in this course, but
I do want to briefly go
over why they're necessary.
So the world is three dimensional, right?
It's a, most folks think of it a sphere,
other folks maybe who
have taken a cartography class
think of it as an ellipsoid.
It's actually something called a geoid,
which takes into account all of
the little mountains and valleys
that distort the shape of the earth.
So then we have a,
a three dimensional world here and
in order to take something that's round
and three dimensional and represent it on
a 2D surface like for instance,
a tablet or a computer, or a smartphone.
You really have to make
certain sacrifices.
This is necessary.
And if you're going to show the whole
surface of the geoid here on a 2D screen,
you have to distort the surface somehow.
Arthur Robinson, who's been described as
the founder of the modern discipline of
cartography in the United States,
he described the situation as follows.
Take an orange and
draw something on it, say human face.
Now carefully remove the peel,
trying to keep it in one piece, and
flatten it against your kitchen table.
You'll see that in making a two
dimensional object out of a round one,
something has to give.
Either the face gets distorted and
looks all mushed out.
Or in flattening the peel,
it breaks into segments, dividing
the face as well into several parts.
Now there are all sorts of ways
that people have come up for
flattening the orange peel, or
stepping away from the analogy,
distorting the surface of the Earth.
Now each of these ways is
called a map projection.
And each map projection seeks to preserve
some property of the surface of the Earth,
siphoning all of the air from
the distortion into other properties.
[SOUND] So, Google and other online and
mobile maps use a projection called
Web Mercator, which is a minor derivation
of the typical Mercator projection.
The Mercator projection is a very
old projection that was designed to
preserve properties that were useful for,
for sailing, actually, in the 1500s.
However, as it turns out,
Mercator also has some properties that
are really valuable for maps in the 2010s.
Namely, North can always be up.
Mercator is a computational
inexpensive algorithm to implement.
And there are, is very little distortion
with Mercator at zoomed in scales.
And this is a very important use case for,
or high level use case for
Google Maps, right?
Most of what we do in Google Maps
is at a zoomed in scale.
Now, the Mercator projection also happens
to result in a rectangular global map,
which means that it also fills
up the browser quite nicely.
Of course as I was just mentioning,
when it comes to projections
there are inherent tradeoffs.
You can't win somewhere
without losing somewhere else.
And when it comes to Mercator, the loss,
and it's a big loss, is that at global and
regional scales like we see here,
Mercator extensively
misrepresents the size of places.
Especially as one gets closer and
closer to the poles of the North Pole and
the South pole.
So for example, let me ask you,
which region here is larger?
Greenland or Mexico?
Now even though the Mercator Projection
makes Greenland look,
I don't know,
something like 10 times larger.
As it turns out they're actually
basically the same size.
I Greenland is 2.17 million square
kilometers, and Mexico is 1.94 million.
The map here is really distorting
the area of these two regions,
particularly Greenland because
it's closer to the Pole.d.
Now there's a major side effect here,
and that is that since online and
mobile maps that use Web Mercator
have become the predominate way by
which people experience cartography,
these misrepresentations are migrating
into people's mental maps of the world.
In fact, I bet if you ask most people on
the street the question I just asked you,
they'd answer the same way as if they
were looking directly at a Mercator map.
Mercator Projections were quite prolific
prior to online and mobile maps.
But Google Maps and its competitors
are certainly doing a lot to
make this how people around
the world see the world.
Before we leave projections,
I want to briefly discuss what is
called the unprojected projection,
which involves plotting longitude and
latitude coordinates.
Which are angular in nature as X,
Y coordinates, which are linear in nature.
Unlike all other commonly used
projections, the unprojected projection
preserves absolutely nothing, so
it distorts absolutely everything.
For exploratory data analysis and
intermediate projects,
this is totally okay.
You know, I do this myself you know, when
I'm working with colleagues showing them
the results of some study or
these types of things.
But for presentation or
publication at least use Web Mercator,
this is the unprojected
projection is not acceptable.
Also and
this is actually more critical and
occurs for very similar reasons you
should actually never use latitude and
magnitude coordinates for
area or distance calculations.
Which is something I see a surprising
number of computer scientists,
in particular doing in both industry and
actually in published papers and
academia as well.
Now the reason you don't want to do this
is that lat, as a latitude increases,
a degree of longitude here becomes
a shorter, and shorter, and shorter, and
shorter linear distance as you
move up in latitude, right?
So as such, 5.26 degrees squared, or
3.2 degrees used as linear distance,
mean something very different
at different latitudes.
At the equator it's, it's bigger or
longer, towards the poles it's smaller or
shorter.
So if you see results reported
in decimal degrees squared, or
distances reported in decimal degrees,
you can inform the person presenting these
results that you might as well present
areas in, for instance, hamburger size,
which you know, of course, varies across
the country and around the world.
And you know, distance and
length of sandwiches, right?
There are all sorts of different
lengths of sandwiches.
Because that's basically
the same precision and
consistency as the reporting if they
were to report something like this.
Now, the second disadvantage of online and
mobile maps.
We're done with our first one here.
The second one is that, and
this is not often discussed in spatial
computing, but there are a number of
use cases where paper maps are actually
still better than online and mobile maps.
And in particular,
there are two I want to talk about.
The first of these advantages for paper
maps is that paper maps actually afford
a much larger display size,
very cheaply, as you can see here.
Right?
We've got our little smartphone map, and
our much larger paper map.
And another, another advantage of paper
maps that folks often don't think about,
is that they require absolutely
zero power after they've been made,
which is definitely not
true of smartphones and
laptops, which need to be,
powered very frequently.
So for instance,
in emergency scenarios, having a paper
map is a good thing to have around.
Now, I thought a great way to hammer
home this zero-power, requirement for
paper maps, or
in this case stone maps, was to reiterate
or to bring back up this stone map here.
This lasted 14,000 years and there wasn't
any power involved once the person put in
the effort to ash this into stone.
Right?
The third disadvantage of many online and
mobile maps comes from their terms
of use and related restrictions.
Now we're not going to go into
a great deal of detail here,
as that's probably more appropriate for
a course taught by a legal expert,
which I'm not.
However, I do want to highlight
that all commercial, online and
mobile maps have terms of
use that prevent a number of
different applications of their maps or
imagery.
So for example, here's Google's FAQ
page on using Google Maps and
Google Earth in printed materials and
offline media.
You can see here there
are a number of restrictions.
For instance, if you thought that
you were going to start a business
to sell t-shirts with little portions of
Google Maps on them you would
be breaking their terms of use.
There are a number of different rules when
you want to use Google Maps and print.
For instance,
if you're in the news media and so on and
so forth,
you can check out more rules here.
And actually if you look at Google's
documentation more broadly,
you'll see that if you use
Google Maps on your website, for
instance, if you're Hotels.com and
you use it to show all the available and
non-available hotels on a given night.
Or, for instance,
if your door dashing, and
you use it to show all the restaurants
that are available near your location, and
you happen to generate more than 25,000
map loads in 90 consecutive days,
you actually have to start paying Google
to use Google Maps, even through the API,
which is something that those even the
technical track might be familiar with.
There is however,
one online map that is much more
open when it comes to terms of use.
And that is, as you might have guessed,
OpenStreetMap.
OpenStreetMap's map tiles are licensed
under the creative commons
attribute share alike 2.0 generic license.
That's a mouth full.
But it's relatively easy to
understand if you take a look at
the creative comments webpage here.
So this license means that with
OpenStreetMap's tiles you can copy and
redistribute them in any medium or format
you can remix and transform them and build
on the tiles, and you can even do this in
a product that makes you money, right?
We saw that Google wouldn't let you do,
make t-shirts.
You can make t-shirts
with open street map.
However, if you do this, you must,
must, must attribute OpenStreetMap.
If you use OpenStreetMap tiles period,
you must attribute OpenStreetMap and
do so appropriately, and if you make
modifications of the OpenStreetMap tiles
you have to distribute those modifications
under the same license here.
This was just about OpenStreetMap,
OpenStreetMap's tiles, excuse me.
OpenStreetMap data has a, a very similar
very similar licensing structure.
Be sure to check out
OpenStreetMap copyright and
licensing page here for more information.
Okay, time for the fourth disadvantage
we're going to be talking about today,
which is the cartographic
hegemony of online and
mobile maps, particularly Google Maps.
Now, prior to online and mobile maps,
we accessed maps by all sorts of
different cartographers from all
sorts of different organizations.
These days, on the other hand,
we generally look at the world through a
single map made by a single organization,
and that organization is typically Google,
although, this is true of
increasingly Apple as well for those of
you who rely on Apple maps on your phone.
Now this means that one organization's
representation or point of
view about the world is being blasted
into our brains on a very frequent basis.
And on a practical level, this means that
mistakes can have outside excuse me,
outsized implications.
So for instance, Nicaragua recently
invaded Costa Rica by accident because it
put too much faith in Google Maps and
Google Maps had a mistake as to which
country controlled a particular island.
Now along the same lines, cartographers
local to a particular area or
more familiar with the audience of
a particular map, may make entirely
different choices than Google about
how to make a map of a specific area.
So for instance, in a recent paper,
some colleagues and I compared
the cartographic choices made by map
makers of publicly displayed local maps.
And the cartographic choices
made by popular online and
mobile maps, in which we found
an enormous number of differences.
So for instance, local maps often
include what we call space usage rules.
These include things like no camping,
no dogs, and so on, like you can see here.
Now, unlike many publicly displayed
local maps, Google Maps and
its competitors currently do not
display any space usage rules.
Since more and more people are likely
ignoring publicly displayed local maps,
and instead looking at their smartphone
maps, the fact that space usage rules
are not displayed on smartphone maps
really presents a risk to public safety,
public order, the environment,
and so on and so forth.
We've actually started a project
here to help map these rules so
they can be included in online and
mobile maps in the future.
You can read more about this project
in our tech report at this URL here.
We've also teamed up with
the informatiCup in Germany, and
made mapping space usage rules actually
this year's informatiCup challenge.
Now, for those of you who speak German and
are in the technical track, and
I know there are some of you,
I really encourage you to participate.
Okay, so those are some of the more
practical disadvantages of
having just a few map makers to find
our choreographic views of the world.
It's important to point out that there are
also some critical higher level concerns.
So Google, Apple, Microsoft, et cetera,
they all map and surface things on
the map that are in some direct or
indirect way in their commercial interest.
So for instance the places where homeless
people tend to spend the night are not
displayed on any of these maps.
Now because of our reliance on these maps,
we don't have access to
information about the importance of these
places to this disadvantaged population.
Now similarly,
richer places tend to get mapped first.
So for instance,
here is a map of from Apple Maps,
of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This is one of the poorest countries
in Europe, and you can see from the,
the equivalent satellite photo that
Apple really missed a ton of the,
the roads there, right?
So for comparison,
here's Apple Map showing Santa Barbra,
California, which is a smaller,
but a much richer city.
You can see that Santa Barbra is much
more completely mapped even though it's
population is less than that of
Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Consider for
instance this map of the University of
Minnesota's Minneapolis campus.
For general reference purposes,
this map is great, but let's say I want to
make a reference map that emphasizes
the location of bike, of bike paths, or
running paths or some other type of
feature rather than the roads for
cars, which is what is emphasized,
typically, in online and mobile maps.
Now, since I can't edit the base map,
this is going to be quite difficult, and
there all sorts of reasons why I
might want to do this type of thing.
For instance, I had a student in one of my
seminars here last semester who worked on
a class project that involved
the mobile map app that would adapt its
cartographic approaches to
the user's current activity.
So for instance if the user were jogging,
it would show a jogging oriented map.
If the user were walk, were walking,
it would do the equivalent, and so on and
so forth.
This type of app is very difficult to
implement using existing mobile maps.
And their, and their APIs because we
actually can't edit the base map.
Another example of this limitation
comes from rural areas.
Google Maps often struggles to
communicate the variation and
the size of quality of
roads in these areas.
So, for instance, here is Google Maps
showing a portion of rural Minnesota.
The road I'm on here, you can see a blue
dot is not very good quality asphalt.
But still asphalt.
It could use a resurfacing.
However, when I, I decided to try and
take a shortcut here which is shown in
the same cardiographic symbol, right?
Same symbol here as here this
road here looked like this.
As you can see, that is not asphalt, that
is dirt and to a certain extent, grass.
Now if I wanted to use Google Maps or
its API to make a location in
where technology for rural areas.
For instance, one that has much
better road quality discrimination at
the low end of the quality spectrum.
There's no easy way for me to do this
because I need to alter the base map.
Of course Google and its competitors
do generally provide a selection of
different base maps through
various settings and options, so
we all know that we can turn
on the satellite view here.
We've seen this several
times in this lecture.
And actually, if we go to Google My Maps,
we can also use the terrain base map here.
Or the Simple Atlas base map.
Or the Whitewater base map.
There are a number of them, however,
no matter how many you make,
they can't come close to covering all the
possible base map needs, which means that
Google Maps and other online and mobile
maps are going to be less useful for
a certain number of
reference map use cases.
They're useful for the majority of them
but they're less useful for some of them.
Fortunately, using some new tools and
open data, like that from OpenStreetMap,
many of these limitations can
actually be addresses with folks
with even limited technical skills.
Learning the basics of how to do so
is the goal of this module’s programming
assignment, but we’ll leave that
to the details of the assignment.
For now, we’ve gone through our five
limitations of popular online and
mobile reference maps,
which means that I will be seeing you in
the next lecture when we're going to
turn our attention to thematic maps.
