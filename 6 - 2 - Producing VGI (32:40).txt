Welcome back to the Volunteered
Geographic Information module.
Now in the last video we
covered the definition and
historical context of volunteered
geographic information.
This means we can move onto
a particularly fun part of
the Volunteered Geographic Information
module, which involves actually getting
our hands dirty and
actually contributing VGI ourselves.
The goal here is to help you
become more familiar with VGI.
And also to help you gain a better
understanding of what VGI is all about.
And more effectively use VGI in any
spatial computing projects you may
be involved in.
In the previous video, we talked about
a number of different sources of
volunteer geographic information.
For instance,
we talked about OpenStreetMap and
we talked about geotagged flickr photos.
VGI is still a relatively new area so,
there is no widely accepted
categorization of VGI data sources.
That said, it's clear that three types of
VGI have been particularly influential.
The first type of VGI that
we're going to consider and
that has been very influential
is social media VGI.
So here we're talking
about geotagged tweets.
Yelp reviews which are,
of course, associated with
a specific store in the real world.
And of course, geotagged photos.
The second type is VGI that arises out
of peer-production communities like
Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap.
Now, these again are peer-production
communities because there's no
expert leading the charge.
It's all a bunch of peers
working together, and
we'll see a lot more about
that in a little bit.
Now, finally, the third major type of VGI
that we're going to talk about today, but
not really focused on for the rest of
the module is Citizen Science VGI.
Finally, the third major type
of VGI is Citizen Science VGI.
We're going to be focusing
on social media VGI and
peer-production VGI for
most of this module.
But in this video we're going to get
a quick sample of Citizen Science VGI so
you'll get an understanding
of what it's about.
You'll sample the flavor
of Citizen Science and
if you're excited about it we
can point you to more resources.
As we discussed in the last
video social media VGI is
effectively social media with a geotag.
And now if you'll remember a geotag is a
geographic reference typically a latitude
and longitude coordinate.
Attached to a piece of content,
in this case a social media post.
So the first type of social
media VGI we're really going to
dig into is Twitter VGI or
geotagged tweets, but before we get into
how you create a geo-tag tweet and how
you access a geotag tweet I want to talk a
bit more about how geotag tweets are used.
They're an incredibly important resource
in a lot of areas of research and
practice in computer science and
geography these days,
in spatial computing, more generally.
They've truly changed the game in
a number of application areas and
they have created some
new application areas.
And let me show you
what I'm talking about.
So this here, is a map of
tweets, geotagged tweets
during the USA-Portugal game.
Which occurred during the World Cup for
me about a month ago, for
you guys, a few more,
months than a, just one month ago.
The red here indicates,
tweets that Twitter has judged using some
texts analysis to be in favor of Portugal.
And the blue tweets are of course, tweets
that are in favor of the United States.
And then you can watch how many of
these tweets exist throughout the game.
So I'm going to play this video here.
You can see, up in Europe there, that
there are a number of Portuguese fans,
which makes sense.
[LAUGH] Same in, in Brazil.
We can watch and, and as we hit a goal
you'll see a big explosion in tweets,
so I think there's a goal coming up
here by the United States as I recall.
Was a good moment for me if there are any
Portuguese fans, oh there it is [LAUGH]
was not so much not,not,
not such a good moment for you folks.
Another goal by the USA I
believe was Clint Dempsey and
then here's the heartbreak
Portugal scored at the very end.
So you can see this type
of application would have
never been possible
without social media VGIs.
Just something that's fundamentally new.
Same type of deal here.
This is a screengrab from a really
interesting research paper.
I recall reading it when it came out,
it's a 2010 paper.
I recall reading it when it come and
I was just blown away.
Effectively what these researchers,
have done it at, at what they,
they didn't report in this paper and
it, it's, it's
a really been influential in the field
a lot of, a lot of papers site this paper.
Is they effectively developed
a earthquake monitoring system
just looking at tweets so
they can figure out.
Where an earthquake is and to a certain
extent they can also figure out
where it's, where the waves
are traveling and how fast and
these types of things just by watching
when people tweet about earthquakes.
It's some pretty impressive stuff.
A third application here is
also from the research domain,
this is pretty interesting,
it's from public health.
And public health has
been quite active in,
in incorporating geotag social media
into its research and its practice.
And, and what you're looking at here is
a series of maps of the United States.
And the colors here, they the,
these researchers aren't using,
sort of best practices cartography,
which is typical within computer science.
One reason why we're offering
the spatial computing course.
You'll notice there's a whole module
on cartography and on geovisualization.
So the important thing to know here though
is that sort of these darker colors
indicate places where there are a lot
of tweets about allergies, right?
So they did, they wrote an algorithm
that could detect those tweets.
Lighter places are places where there
are fewer tweets about allergies.
And this makes sense, right?
In February in the United States,
the, these are warmer areas.
So there's not a lot of snow in
these areas, outside of mountains.
So they get allergies first.
Here we are in Minnesota.
In February,
we are covered in snow, usually, so
not a lot of opportunities for allergies.
But you can see by April,
that has all changed.
And they were able to detect
this just by looking at
the types of things people tweet, so
pollen bloom et cetera, et cetera.
These applications are super,
super advanced.
Right?
But they all start with
something very simple.
And that is a person using
a Twitter application.
Now this application can be on
a smartphone, it can be on a computer.
It can be on an iPad or whatever.
For the most part,
though, these geotagged tweets
are going to be coming from smartphones.
And we can, we'll be talking
a lot more about why that is in
the positioning lecture.
But these amazing algorithms all
start with something very simple,
which is a geotagged tweets.
And let's walk through how you
send a geotagged tweet out to
your Twitter followers.
Okay, here we are.
We are going to, write a geotag tweet.
This is the Android app
Android Twitter app.
I'm an iPhone user primarily
I'm trying to learn Android for
you all because I suspect most
of you are Android users.
So do forgive me if I make
any stupid mistakes here.
You can see here we're in
the Android Twitter app.
We're under the account,
the spatial computing MOOC account.
You should follow this account
if you're a Twitter user.
We will be tweeting very
interesting tweets hopefully.
You can see there's a little lock here.
That will removed by
the time you guys see this.
okay, let's write our tweet.
I have pre-prepared a, a witty tweet
here as our first geotag tweet.
It's very exciting.
So here we go.
Is this the first live
tweet from a MOOC video?
And then here's my, here's my joke.
For those of you who are Oscars fans.
Okay, here is my Android mistakes.
There we go.
There's a question mark.
Okay, It's like, let's try that again.
It's like Ellen at the Oscars.
I'll try that too.
I bet I could have just let
auto correct handle that.
Let's try this.
Very good.
Okay, it's like Ellen at the Oscars!
For those of you who watched
the Oscars this year.
I'm missing an apostrophe there,
but hey, it's Twitter.
All right, let's add a hashtag.
Can't have a tweet without a hashtag.
None of those vgirocks,
how's that, hashtag.
Okay, now here comes a critical part.
see, if you see this push pin here,
that is the push pin to geotag my tweet.
You can see Twitter is asking
me if it can use my location.
I'm going to say yes in this case.
And voila, there I am in the lovely
University of Minnesota MOOC Studios, and
I'm going to send this geotag
tweet off to the Twitter verse.
Okay, so
we sent our tweet to the Twitter verse.
What happens now?
Well if you follow me over here
to the screen, I'll show you.
We can open up a Twitter client.
Only some of them will do this, and
we'll talk about that in a second.
But this is, this is Echofon.
It's a Twitter you can get for
free in the Mac app store.
I don't know what
the deal is with Windows.
It might also be available for Windows.
And you can see here is my tweet.
Is this the, is this the first
live tweet from a MOOC video?
It's like Ellen at the Oscars.
Very good.
And you can
see there's a little
green a push pin here.
That indicates that it's geotagged.
And what do you know?
If I double click there, or
maybe single click, it will tell
me where this tweet came from.
So I send this tweet out
to all my followers,
all my followers can see where I was and
I have opted in to that process.
You'll notice though that if you look at
some of these geotag tweets on the Twitter
website for instance, you actually won't
see the precise location Twitter's been
changing this a lot lately so by the time
you watch this video it might even be
different but I do want to point this out,
you'll see it does say that it was
tweeted from Minneapolis, Minnesota which
is where the University of Minnesota is.
But if I click on this it
doesn't show me a map,
it shows me all the other
tweets from Minneapolis.
And you can see there's lots of
fun things to do in Minneapolis.
But it does not show me the specific, oh.
That's a nice one!
[LAUGH] It does not show me the specific
location from where I tweeted.
So we saw that your Twitter followers and
actually if you have public
Tweets which most people do.
Anyone who can access the Twitter
website or use a Twitter client can.
Anyone can see not only your.
The content of your geotag tweet but
also the geotag as well.
But it's not only people that can do that.
Any programmer worth her or
his salt can write a quick program
to download a huge number of geotech
tweets that people publish from all over
the world or from a from a specific area.
So for instance,
in just a couple of minutes,
I was able to write a quick program that
downloads all the tweets that Twitter will
provide me that mention the term
Justin Bieber with Justin Bieber being,
of course,
a very important topic on Twitter.
Now, when I said, all the tweets
that Twitter will provide me,
well, Twitter charges a lot of money for
folks who want all tweets.
What programmers can do, is they can
get a, subsample of, or, excuse me,
a sample of tweets.
A very small sample,
but, since there are so
many tweets, you'll see there, there
are quite a few that you can download.
So lets move on over to my program here.
And, I hit the go button, and
what this program is doing is just saying,
hey twitter anything that has
Justin Bieber in it lately?
Okay, so what we're looking at now is a
sample of tweets that are published right
now, right this second that
have the word Bieber in it.
You can see that we've stopped here in our
program I've said on my programs that it
stops when it finds a geotag tweet, so for
instance here is a geotag tweet, from
this latitude and longitude coordinate.
We'll hit enter and
you can see how fast these,
this actually very small sample of overall
tweet comes in just because there are so
many people tweeting about
Justin Bieber at any given time.
Here's a geotag tweet, this one here
from this latitude-longitude coordinate.
And we can keep going, and
keep going, and keep going.
And one thing you'll notice is that a
small percentage of tweets are geotagged.
I mentioned this in the last video.
The numbers vary depending on the research
study, but in general it's around 1 to 3%.
We can keep going and going and
going lots of tweets about Justin Bieber.
Probably not so
many tweets about spacial computing.
Okay, so that's that for Twitter.
Let's move on over to Instagram.
I'm going to open
the Instagram app on Android.
You can see this is the spacial
computing Instagram feed.
Lots of fun stuff including my one
of my favorite players from my
San Francisco forty-niners.
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take an Instagram photo.
We're going to geotag it and
we're going to upload it.
So let's open up the photos here and
let's look at the wonderful guys
who have been responsible for
so many of your MOOC experiences
here at the University of Minnesota.
Hey, guys, guys!
You're on camera.
[LAUGH] Say cheese.
[NOISE] very cool.
All right,
now we gotta pick a good filter.
That's a pretty good shot.
Let's do X-Pro 2.
These guys are pretty cool guys,
so X-Pro 2 sounds cool.
Let's go over here, it's processing.
And now here comes the geotagging.
Let's see, ca,
let's put up the message here, right?
So, cool MOOC MOOC dudes I think that's
what we'll do right, that makes sense.
Okay, and we will now geotag it which is
just this thing they call add to Photo Map
now again it's telling me that in this
case I, that it's association location.
It's also telling me on Instagram.
You can do this on Twitter as well.
You can remove locations,
locations from all your tweets, or
in this case, all your, Instagram photos.
Boom, there we are.
I'm going to hit the, the,
check mark there, and
we have a geotagged Instagram photo.
And we should be able to see that.
In my overall photo map, which is here.
There it is.
It should be approximately
the same location.
More specifically,
exactly the same location,
minus any positional, positioning error.
There is our MOOC Studio, fantastic.
And, there are to the two cool Mook dudes.
So, just as was the case with Twitter,
not only can my Insta, Instagram followers
see my photo and the geotag on that
photo programmers can do this as well.
Again, quite easily using
pre-existing libraries.
Again I wrote some very quick
code just to download all of the,
all of the most recent geotagged photos
in the University of Minnesota area,
geotag Instagram photos.
And we'll run that right now and
you'll see that there are lots.
And you'll see that there are probably
a lot of people don't know that they're,
they're, Instagram photos
are being geotagged.
So here we're going to run this program.
It's downloading all of the most recent,
decided to jump over here, all of
the most recent Instagram photos from my
area, from the University of Minnesota.
I can see there are a bunch of them,
there it goes.
And it's downloading them
straight to my hard drive.
So let's take a look at these
photos as they come in.
Come and go into this folder.
For those of you who aren't programmers,
I'd imagine this,
I would just think to myself this
might be surprising that this is so
easy to get all these photos but
let's take a look.
Look at all these Instagram photos of
random people in the University of
Minnesota area.
At least you can see people around here
tend to have a good amount of fun.
This is our beautiful art museum.
I highly recommend you come visit.
And you'll notice that if we look
closely there are our cool MOOC dudes so
we were able to pick this
one up with the the code.
Okay, so that should give you a good
idea of how you create social media VGI,
how that VGI is accessed by your friends,
followers, contacts, the general public.
And also how it's accessed by
a spacial computing technologies.
Obviously most spacial computing
technologies that take advantage of social
media VGI are much more advanced than the
very quick programs I wrote for you guys.
But that should give you the basic idea.
I do want to pop up a bit
to a a higher level and
just go over three high level points
in terms of how social media VGI works.
There's basically a three-step process.
You create content,
you geotag it, and you upload it.
Your friends and your contacts,
or the general public, right,
if you don't have things protected,
can see your geotagged content, right.
We saw that for instance over here,
right with the Echofon app.
And in many cases,
programmers can download your geotagged
content, assuming it's public.
Okay so let's move on to the second
type of VGI we're going to
consider in this lecture, and
that is a pure production VGI and for
that we are going to first look and
do a deep into Wikipedia base VGI.
Here we are on
the English Wikipedia's main page,
I'm sure many of you are familiar
with the main page here,
I'm pretty sure most of you are also
familiar with the fact that Wikipedia can
be edited by literally anyone the one
challenge though especially if
you're not a Wikipedia editor,
is knowing what to edit right?
How can you help out?
Well one way to figure that out is
to go to the community portal here.
It's on the left-hand
side of all the pages.
And here's a list of pages that need
help and what you can do to help them.
Spelling and grammar for
instance is very, very easy to get into.
You don't need to be a Wikipedia expert
to correct spelling and grammar.
So we're going to go, do some of that and
I found a perfect article for
this this video.
It is on the second page here and
it is the West Campus High School article.
Apparently West Campus High School is
a high school in Sacramento, California.
This is an area where my brother and
sister-in-law live.
It's a very nice area,
unfortunately, the page for
West Campus High School is not so nice.
You can see it has a ton
of listed issues by
Wikipedians have gone through it and
listed this.
So, there's some neutrality issues.
They require some grammar editing.
And so on and so forth,
so we're going to take,
we're going to do some very lightweight
editing, this page, show you how it works.
The very, very important thing to notice
is that this article is geotagged,
which means we're dealing
with pure production VGI.
Right, If it weren't geotagged,
or more specifically if it
were about an entity that doesn't
have a specific spatial footprint.
Then we wouldn't be dealing with a VGI,
we'd be dealing with just
pure produced content.
But this is content about a place in
the real world, so we're interested in,
in it, in this spatial computing course.
Now, to edit this article,
we are going to just go ahead and
hit the edit here, and wow,
it's just right there.
I will note that this page actually has
a spe, is a little bit a special case.
Almost every page you can edit
without actually even logging in.
This page they've
partially locked it down.
Probably because high school students
are some of the biggest vandalizers
of Wikipedia.
But we will continue on and
I'll show you that you can edit some
very important pages without logging in.
This is just a something
of a special case.
Okay, so
we're going to read what it says here.
West Campus High School
is a public high school.
So it is a public college preparatory
high school in Sacramento California.
This school serves about 800 students.
Blabidy blabidy blah.
So then it says here West Campus
used to be a satellite school of
nearby Hiram Johnson but
it became its own school for
the 2002-2003 school year and
this isn't very, encyclopedic.
It doesn't sound very professional.
And it's missing an important link.
And links are really important for
a number of reasons.
It's of course fun to click
around on in Wikipedia, but
for the many applications that use
Wikipedia as a source of world knowledge,
in the spatial computing domain.
Links between two places
tell those algorithms, or
tell those computing systems
to tell those algorithms, hey,
these two places are maybe more related
than two places that don't have a link.
So adding this link will be important.
Now to do what,
we are going to have to figure out
what on earth they're talking about.
I suspect this is another high
school in the Sacramento area.
So let's try to figure that out.
Hiram Johnson High School, perhaps?
We'll Google it, and
that is indeed what it is.
We'll go to their Wikipedia page,
and there is the title.
It's a much smaller article.
We could also add some
content to this one.
Fortunately I'm not an expert
on Hiram W.Johnson High School.
If any of you are I encourage
you to edit this article.
Okay, so we know this is called this.
And in Wikipedia to add a link you
just do these two little brackets.
Don't worry about this too much if you're
interested in it you can worry about it.
You'll see that you don't have to
know brackets to help out as well.
So okay, so,
West Campus used to be a satellite school.
Now satellite school, okay.
Let's say satellite high school, right?
Of nearby Hiram W.Johnson High School, but
became its,
became perhaps an independent school.
That sounds more professional, right?
More encyclopedia,
more encyclopedic, excuse me.
[SOUND] In school beginning in
the 2002-2003 school year.
Okay, we're just going to stop there and
we will hit save.
There's obviously a lot more to do here.
If you read down the article there's
some things that are clearly written by
someone who was a fan of the school and
perhaps doesn't know how to
write encyclopedic articles,
as well as he or she should.
And we hit save page.
And we wait.
And we find that we have a link.
And we have our text here, right?
I just changed how the world views West
Campus High School by producing in, a,
excuse me,
by participating in peer produced VGI.
If you're anything like me you find this
very, you'll find this very empowering.
Now let's take a step back and see,
look at some other peer produced VGI.
geo, in other words
geotagged Wikipedia pages so
let's look at the University
of Minnesota page.
Just to show you how powerful you can
be even as not a logged in editor.
Now anyone can create an account of course
but just as someone who has no history of
editing at all let's go back to
the University of Minnesota here.
And I can just go ahead and
edit this very important article.
I mean, University of Minnesota has tens
of 1000s of students a huge university
very prominent university but
I can edit anything I want.
If I were a bad person, I could vandalize.
For instance, I could say, let's see,
it is, it is a wonderful school to study,
study in for terrible grammar.
We're not going to publish this anyway.
Especially for students who get to know
us through the spatial computing MOOC.
Now, if I were a bad person,
I can good ahead and hit save.
I'm not a bad person.
So I'm going to click out of here and
leave page.
But you get the idea.
If I did click save,
I would be contribute peer-produced VGI.
Although doing so
in a somewhat malicious way.
So as I mentioned before Wikipedia's
a very prominent source of
peer produced VGI.
But OpenStreetMap is perhaps not as
well-known in the general public.
But among folks in spatial computing
OpenStreetMap definitely is
equally prominent.
With respect to, Wikipedia.
So here we have OpenStreetMap I
have logged in as an editor.
In OpenStreetMap you have
to log in as an editor.
And you can see the map.
Once again, you'll recall the last video,
this map is, the data in this map
is used in all sorts of systems.
You can download it yourself and
use it in whatever you want.
And it's a great way to Bootstrap a,
a new spatial computing project, for
those of you who are in
technological track.
but, this OpenStreetMap's
used by MapQuest now,
it's used in Apple products, it's used
in who knows how many other products.
so, but, but, here's the,
here's the actual real map.
You can also go to the map just
by going to openstreetmap.org.
Here's the, here we can zoom, zoom around.
This is the University of Minnesota.
You've seen this map a couple times today.
And if I click Edit you'll see that
the entire map becomes editable by me,
which is totally crazy.
I, I'm, I'm let's actually
just reset that for now.
I am still kind of blown away
by the extent to which you can
change how this very important
data set views the world.
So again we're going to do something and
not, we're not going to save it but so
here's the st, here's the street right?
Let's just take this street here and
lets eh,
let's, let's change where the street goes.
Now it goes over here,
look there's an intersection too right?
If I did this and we ran routing on,
on OpenStreetMap data which is
done by a number of systems.
We might have a a route
that doesn't exist right?
I'm going to go back because I'm not
a malicious person and let's add
something that's useful and OpenStreetMap
is in many ways pretty complete
with respect to basic stuff there's
some more advanced things for instance
tags that are definitely not complete and
some more detailed types of layers.
But for the basic stuff it can
be sometimes hard to find a,
a new thing in certain types
of areas particularly cities.
But let's add something that I did
notice is not here which is one of
my favorite lunch spots around here.
And that is Bruegger's Bagels.
Now it's just a chin bagel place.
If I eat a big lunch I sometimes get very,
very sleepy, so
I like just simple lunches.
We'll select the feature type here.
It's a cafe.
The name is Bruegger's Bagels.
And I'm just going to double check my
notes here to make sure I spelled that
correctly, cause that is a rough spelling,
at least for English speakers.
Those of you who are German may
think I had a very easy task there.
In choosing cuisine I'm I
actually was looking earlier and
it was like,
maybe coffee shop's the best or
sandwich but I couldn't decide, so
let's just put that aside for now.
You don't have to do everything.
And there's an address.
So let's put an address, I looked this up,
it's 720 University Avenue Southeast.
So, 720, University Avenue Southeast,
and of course, Minneapolis,
and, postal code is 55414.
And we could look up the hours and
these types of things.
There's a whole bunch of other options.
Does it have wheelchair access,
I don't know.
This is a great feature that they have,
and so on and so forth.
But I think this is good enough for now.
And let's actually hit save.
And there we go.
The changes that you upload as,
as spacial comp class.
That's, that's, what we are.
We, visible on all maps that
use OpenStreetMap data.
Look at that,
we just contributed to OpenStreetMap.
So, that's peer production VGI.
Hopefully you know more about,
peer produced,
geo, reference information than you
did before you, you started the video.
Let's move on quickly to the last
of these three social media
types Citizen science VGI.
A citizen science VGI is important but
maybe more specialized than the other two.
So our focus in the rest of this module
is going tot be on the other two.
But I wanted to give you an,
an understanding of what citizen
science VGI is all about.
To do that of course we need to grab
a definition of citizen science and
I thought since we just looked at peer
produced content it might be fun to
see what Wikipedia came up with when it
comes to citizen science's definition.
And they came out with this,
which I actually think is quite good.
Citizen science is scientific research
conducted, in whole or in part,
by amateur or nonprofessional scientists
often by crowdsourcing and crowdfunding.
That's a pretty good definition.
It gives you an understanding of
what's going on some keywords here
are amateur and nonprofessional scientists
and real scientific research though but
this is legitimate scientific research.
And so much of citi, so
much of citizen science involves.
Research projects that have some
sort of geographic reference,
some spacial reference.
So you can imagine, counting birds this is
a citizens science project that's actually
goes back well before the online era
online era and so on and so forth.
The one I can show you right now without,
you know, going out into a,a wetland, for
instance, in that counting birds or
measuring water levels, is this one.
This is sea floor explorer.
It is a part of the um,zhuniverse
family of citizen science projects,
I really recommend you check it out.
Really low impact and we're actually
going to do a quick demo in a second.
But first I want to go over the science.
Effectively what they're trying to do
is gather from regular old folks, like,
like you and me in this case training data
to train machines to understand what types
of species are on the sea floor, where
they are and, and so on and so forth.
And for instance, they want to allow
scientists to ask questions like what is
the current distribution and
abundance of sea scallop and
yellowtail flounder on Georgia's bank?
These types of things.
These are questions, obviously,
that are very important for
a fishery's management, understanding the.
The success and, and
decline of species and so on and
so forth and we as regular old folks can
help them solve this scientific problem.
So let's walk through
demo real quick here.
Okay so here we are on sea floor
explorer very, it's very simple.
There is some quick training you can
take before you launch into this.
It takes about two minutes and I did that.
And what they want me to do here is,
is say the type of ground that's in
this area which I learned is sand.
Versus shell gravel
cobble boulder et cetera.
Done identifying ground cover.
And then they want me to basically
highlight a whole bunch of
these seastars right or another species.
So, here's one, and
here's one, and here's one.
Oops, that's a little bit off.
And you guys get the picture,
and if I were to do all of these,
I'd just hit, I'd just hit Done, and
the scientist would be able to use this.
In there training or in their building
of machines that or algorithms
that can identify a seastar as separated
from the sand and do this automatically.
Now one thing it's very
important here too is this data.
It's just in and out of itself is,
is quite valuable.
This image here is georeferenced, and
now I know there are a whole bunch
of seastars in this, in this area.
Right, so it's, this is, this becomes what
I'm doing, citizen science VGI, right.
I'm contributing vo,
voluntarily information that
is geographically referenced.
And that is that for citizen science VGI.
Okay, so that's it for
volunteer geographic information.
I do want to do one last
thing in this video and
that's give you an example of
traditional geographic information.
You know, I was talking about this
traditional geographic information.
How different it is from VGI but I think
its helpful, it would be helpful to,
to show you this one example of what
this traditional information look like.
In other words, this would be the type
of information that you would have been
dealing with if you somehow took this
class using some proto YouTube or
something in 1999 versus the VGI era.
Okay so here we, I will show this example.
A very canonical example.
This is the U.S. census bureau's
website and they offer traditional and
geographic information in
the form of shapefiles.
Shapefiles are just a data format for
points, lines and polygons.
Which you guys know all about now.
And you can download shapefiles for
county borders.
You can download shapefiles for
state borders, zip codes, and so on and
so forth.
Census tracks are one that I
find myself frequently using.
But one thing you notice here,
is there's no edit button, right?
If I want to edit some of these files,
it's not going to happen.
That's a key difference right?
We talked about that in the first video.
Traditional geographic information
does not allow that type of thing.
I do want to point out though that
traditional geographic information
it's not like it's replaced by VGI.
I mean, I mentioned this in the first
video but I want to re-emphasize.
VGI adds to our abilities in spacial
computing and it to a certain
extent competes with some aspects of
traditional geographic information.
But traditional geographic information is
still quite useful in, in many cases for
instance, I just mentioned, I like to
use census track data quite a bit in,
in, in my research that doesn't have a,
a correla in in, in VGI.
I just want to give you a quick
example of what this, what this does.
So let's just do state, it'll be a very
quick download let's do this one here.
And there we go.
I downloaded the shape file.
I'm going to open it in some software
called QGIS, just of way of,
of visualizing shape files, and
doing some other geographing
information system operations.
QGIS is a relatively new program but
it's free, open-source and
pretty good and there you go.
There are the state outlines right?
That is a pretty typical
traditional geographic information
scenario, excuse me.
Okay, so that's it for today's video.
I'll see you, see you in the next
video to talk about the third and
the fourth learning
objectives in the VGI module.
