Hello.
Welcome to the University of Minnesota's
massive open online course titled,
From GPS and
Google Maps to Spatial Computing.
I am Dr Shashi Shekhar,
a Professor of Computer Science and
Engineering here at
the University of Minnesota.
And I'm one of the two
Professors of this course.
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Brent Hecht,
the other Professor of the course.
I'm also a Professor of Computer Science
and Engineering here at the U.
Now spatial computing is definitely a hot
topic, both in industry and academia.
It has had, and will continue to have,
an enormous impact in a wide variety of
domains, ranging from computer
science to environmental science.
To geography, to civil engineering, to,
well, the list goes on and on and on.
>> On a personal, level spatial
computing also touches the lives of
billions of people and around the world.
And almost certainly, including you.
For example.
You probably have used an online
mapping service, like Google Maps or
Bing Maps,
to get from one place to the other.
That is spatial computing.
You also probably have done
this on your smartphone, or
GPS device which shows a,
a little dot and a map.
Representing your position,
and that is spacial computing.
>> Many of you have also likely used Yelp,
or Four Square, or Trip Advisor, or
a number of other location based
services to find a great place to
grab a bite to eat.
That's spacial computing.
Many of you have also likely used
Google Earth to look at present day, or
historical satellite imagery,
either as part of a class or on your own.
That's also spatial computing.
>> If you bought a house recently you
likely visited a site like Zillow or
Trulia, to check out information about
various potential neighborhoods.
That is spacial computing.
If you live in a large city,
you may have tried one of the new car
sharing services like [INAUDIBLE] or Lift.
That is spatial computing.
>> Spatial computing is also
changing people's lives,
in a large number of indirect ways.
For instance through something
called Precision Agriculture,
spatial computing is revolutionizing
how farmers grow our food.
Similarly scientists are using
spatial computing technologies,
to better track and
protect the world's biodiversity.
Large organizations are using spacial
computing to minimize pollution and
increase profits at the same time,
and public safety officials are using
spacial computing to reduce crime, and
save lives during natural disasters.
The goal of this course, to help you
begin your journey toward understanding,
how these world changing
technologies work.
For those of you who decide
to join the technical track,
you'll also learn a bit about
how to build these technologies.
But, we'll get to information about
the three tracks of this course,
a bit later in the week.
In the next video, you'll learn about
the definition of spatial computing, and
get an overview of typical problems and
applications in spatial computing.
But, before we end this video,
we wanted to give you a bit more
information about ourselves.
>> So a little bit about myself.
You know, I was born and
raised in India in a small city named
Jempshaper, also called Tata Nagar.
And I completed undergraduate education
at India Institute of Technology Kanpur.
And then came to Berkeley at
University of California for
graduate education,
including Masters and Ph.D.
in disciplines of Business Administration
and Computer Science.
In terms of my research interests,
they are in two or three broad areas.
One broad idea is Spatial Databases.
So, within databases, I worked on Storage
Methods for road maps in early 90s.
In context of in vehicle
navigation devices.
We also worked on routing algorithm.
So, many of the you know,
the applications we see today,
in terms of in car navigation, and so on.
Rare research project.
It's hard to believe that this came
to fruition, during your own career.
More recently we have looked
at evacuation route planning.
And now there are some
projects on eco-routing,
where you choose routes to minimize fuel
conjunction, or greenhouse gas emissions.
Another broad area of research
is Spatial Data Mining.
Where we have essentially
looked at two kinds of issues.
Okay, one we wanted to balance
computational scalability, and
spatial statistical
mathematical interpretation.
And we have been able to present new
presentations interest measures in
pattern families.
Such as core locations, and
cascade, which can do that.
And the last theme in
my research is High-Performance
Geographic Information Systems.
So starting mid 90s we looked
at parallel computing, and
how to use those for
geographic information systems.
So we worked on paralyzing
range queries neural networks,
some of the other
Spatial Data Mining Algorithms.
So this kind of gives you a broad sense of
where I come from, again in a spatialized
general theme and within that I work
more on the data and analytics side.
Thank you.
>> Hey this is Dr. Hecht again.
I was born and
raised in the San Francisco Bay area,
actually very close to Berkeley
where Shashi did his Ph.D work.
I received a bachelor's
degree in Geography and
Computer Science from
McAllister College which is.
Really close to The University
of Minnesota, but in St. Paul,
the other of the two twin cities, The
University of Minnesota is in Minneapolis.
I received a Masters degree in
geography from Univ, The University of
California Santa Barbara beautiful
place and a wonderful geography school.
And then I received my Ph.D in
Computer Science in 2013 from
North Western University.
In terms of my research interests
I focus on spatial computing,
obviously, as well as an,
an area called social computing.
And, in my modules, you'll see that
I incorporate some social computing
into this course, as well, where relevant.
A lot of my research looks at
volunteered geographic information.
And, you'll understand that term a bit
more, when you finish this course.
And it's application.
So I've done a lot of work looking at,
for instance, Flickr data, Wikipedia data,
and, and algorithms that you can
build using these data sources that you
really couldn't build before they existed.
And I also do a lot of work in
information visualization, and
geographic human-computer interaction.
So, innovating in areas like.
Applying some of the, the tools and
techniques you'll learn in this course,
in non-geographic reference systems,
and these types of things.
