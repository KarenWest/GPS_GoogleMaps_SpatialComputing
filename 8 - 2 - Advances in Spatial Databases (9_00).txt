Welcome back to the discussion
of spatial computing.
In this video I want to give a glimpse
of a current research project in
my own group.
And as you know my group is now called
the Spatial Computing Research Group.
And you know, we have done quite a bit
of work over the last several years,
including some authoring of books and
other material.
So you know, the Spatial Database
book we used in spatial equating.
You saw a chapter from there.
We also saw several articles
from Encyclopedia of GIS as
supplementary reading,
over modules two, three and four.
The group has been involved in
managing a journal, you know,
which publishes computer science
research for GIS, that's GeoInformatica.
Managing some of the meetings,
symposium on spacial and
temporal databases,
as well as geographic information signs.
And most recently we helped organize
a community visioning workshop for
computing community consortium.
And this was something that's part
of your reading in, in this week.
And you can kind of see the community
research vision where this field is
headed, and there're a lot of
exciting ideas in this report.
Now my own personal work has focused
on two sub areas of spatial computing.
Back in 90's when I started my career it
was mostly focused on spatial databases.
Something reminiscent of spatial
equating world that you saw.
But you know, we went well beyond
equating to look at also algorithms,
equating processing techniques,
indexing, and so on.
So here are a couple of
projects from that era.
And many of them in some sense
are still very interesting,
even though platforms have changed, okay?
So one project we did,
which was with Army had to do with
paralysing geographic information systems.
And they wanted to speed up
retrieval of real geographic data,
to make tank simulators, you know,
flight simulators more realistic.
So instead of video game-like
synthetic terrains,
they wanted to use real terrains from the,
the theater.
So problem in this case,
essentially is to divide a map.
You know, for example here you're
showing a set of polygons.
And the idea is to divide up the work
among multiple processors in a multi
processing system or a cloud computing
environment, so that the workload for
a range query is equally
divided across processor.
So in this map,
actually the colors of the polygon
there represent process and assignment.
So that if you see this little box,
that's arrange query, and hopefully
the colors are balanced within that.
And if that happens, then you have
actually got in a good speed up
on cloud computing or
parallel computing platform.
So back in mid-90s, we were working with
connection machines on these problems.
Another major theme in the group
has been on routing problems.
And you know, all of us did talked about
location-based services we all enjoyed.
These shortest path queries on our
cellphone, our Google Maps nowadays.
But it is, you know,
you may find it hard to believe, but
these things were research
projects back in early 90's.
So at the beginning of my career,
we got research projects to think about
how road maps should be stored on disks.
And how routing algorithms should be done,
when computing power was much less.
Okay?
And it's really pleasured in your own
career to see your research come to
fruition, and
then come to commercial products.
Okay?
And we still have a new project in
this area called equal routing,
that I will go over in more detail, okay?
But after 9/11 we also got
involved with another very
interesting routing project that had to do
with the evacuation route planning, okay?
As you may have remembered from
the interview of Betsy George from Oracle,
let's say lots of people have
to leave New York City or
Boston because of a hurricane, or
you know this really happened in
Houston Galwestern area with
hurricane Rita in 2005.
If they all went to Google Maps and
followed the routes from Google Maps,
things will not look pretty.
You will have massive traffic jams and
poor utilization of road networks.
So in evacuation route planning, the goal
is to actually find a set of routes.
And even those routes
have to be used again and
again in a pipeline manner by
different groups of people, okay?
The problem gets you know, much harder.
It's a flow networks problem
rather than a graph problem.
Traditional solutions from operations
research based on linear programming and
time expanded graph didn't scale
up to large metropolitan area.
And our group contributed some
very scalable algorithm in
this space about ten years ago.
Many of them actually
got used in the field.
Minnesota Department of Transportation,
chose our algorithms over the competition.
And you know, Fox TV did a nice,
you know, a review of that.
There was a congressional presentation and
so on.
Very, very exciting.
We are still doing some work
on commercializing this, but
let's talk about a new research project.
Something that looks even further ahead.
So we just recently received a grant
from National Science Foundation,
to explore this new exciting
field called big data.
And so we are looking at
obviously spatial big data, and
we are trying to imagine the next big
generation routing and navigation systems.
So you probably already have
heard about the big data.
So I'll just quickly give
you the opportunity here.
So first opportunity is that, you know,
when you use your Google Maps today or
your cell phone and so on for routing,
they usually give you a route that
minimizes distance or travel time, okay?
But with all this concern about climate
change and environment, won't it be
wonderful that we could minimize
greenhouse gas emissions, or fuel uses?
Okay?
So
try to imagine your next generation of
routing system, which allows you to
choose the minimization criteria which
may be more ecologically friendly, okay?
Well why can't we do that
using today's technology?
You know, Google and all, okay?
so, so we'll talk about that briefly.
And also I wanted to tell
you it's not pipe dream.
Actually some people have tried this.
Some of you may have read this story
about UPS, a large delivery system,
changing their routes.
And they like to avoid left turns.
So let me pause here for a second or
two and ask you, you know, yourself what's
going on in left turn in United States?
You know, if you are in Britain or India,
you know, it will be right turn, but
in United States something goes on
in left turn that UPS doesn't like,
which is waiting.
Okay?
Left turn means you have to wait for
the opposing traffic to clear, and
you're idling your engine, and
you're losing fuel.
Right?
And in case of UPS,
when they've change these routes,
their savings were very, very significant.
Millions of gallons per year.
And nowadays in fact the newer cars
that turn off the engines when you
are waiting on, on left turns.
So, now you can imagine, if UPS can
save millions of gallons what happens if
all of us start trying to do that?
Right?
And society as a whole will gain a lot of
you know, it'll reduce field consumption
and greenhouse gas emission.
Okay?
So, so this is an opportunity,
and question is,
now what can we do towards that?
So there are new data sets
which are coming online.
One we call temporally detailed road maps,
and GPS traces, which can
actually give you a very good hint on
where the idling is, where the delays are.
And once you this data you can
reduce that waste of fuel, okay?
But why should computer
scientists play in this space?
Isn't this a mechanical engineering or
operations research problem?
Well, you know,
there is computer science challenge.
And one thing if you
remember in module three,
we learned about shortest path algorithms
like Dijkstra's and A star, and
they all assume dynamic programming
principal or sub path optimality.
It turns out that if you change
your cost metric from distance or
time towards fuel or greenhouse gas
emission, then the dynamic pro-,
.
programming property does not hold.
In other words our algorithms are not
going to help us in this problem.
We need to start afresh and
design new algorithms, okay?
So this is one opportunity in this space.
And there're other opportunities.
For example,
today we usually say well, you know,
if I start right now,
what's the shortest path?
But if you had these new big datasets
like temporarily detailed roadmaps,
which knows your typical week's
behavior minute-by-minute for
the typical week,
you could ask a different question.
You could say,
well I have a meeting at 9 a.m.
What time should I leave home,
to spend least amount of time
on the road network, okay?
And it is something that
today's roadmaps cannot do, but
the new roadmaps which
are temporarily detailed can do.
And there was again a small experiment
in basing, where they showed that if you
leverage UPS tracks, you could beat Google
Map based routes by 30 to 40%, okay?
By, by, by adjusting your start time, and
taking advantage of time variation, okay?
So again, very, very exciting area.
And you know, there're many
opportunities in leveraging big data.
We'd like to acknowledge the support
from National Science Foundation.
This grant which is in red arrow is
supporting some of this research.
And there are other grants listed,
you know,
which is supporting
other work in our group.
So hopefully this gives you a glimpse
of one current project that's going on
in our group.
shortly, you know, we'll look forward
to seeing you in another video,
we'll give you glimpse of another project
in the area of spatial data mining.
Thank you for your attention.
