So welcome back to the discussion of
spatial data mining.
In the first video we simply talked about
the motivation for spatial data mining.
And we saw many, many societal use
cases, ranging from public health to
public safety.
We also tried to informally describe
spatial data mining in terms
of, you know, looking for patterns which
are interesting, useful, and non-trivial.
And we also gave you examples of many
pattern families.
In this video, you know, we are going to
look at the input data.
So that spatial data that is processed
through spatial
data mining is, will be covered in this
video.
When we come back to next video we will
look at statistical foundations.
It turns out that the type of statistics
used for spatial
data is a little bit different than the
traditional conventional statistics.
And then we'll follow that by exploration
of individual
pattern families such as heart sparks and
so on, okay.
So at the end of the first video when we
have
talked about spatial data we should be
able to do three things.
You know, first, describe the basic inputs
of spatial data mining.
In more detail we can talk about the
common spatial data types and operations.
And you may again wonder why we revisiting
the data types and
operations, we did see a little bit of
this in spatial querying anyway.
But in context of data mining machine
learning statistics, there
is an additional motivation, which has to
do with feature selection.
So, when you see this keyword feature
selection,
then that is one way to process spatial
data.
So, people who are familiar with
traditional machine learning statistics
data mining, and are not aware of any
unique techniques that
we will discuss, they would often model
the special parts of
geospatial data in terms of features, such
as distance to water.
Okay?
Something you saw in that baldness
prediction case study.
So again if we know the common spatial
data types and
operations then we will have a better
choice of these features.
So we can go beyond simply distance to
water or distance to
transportation to include other things
such as overlap and things of that kind.
So without further ado, let's, let's go
and look at these data types.
So the first, look at the basic data.
So we are all used to non-spatial data
such as numbers and text strings.
So if we were modeling cities or
countries, we did have some numeric
and text attributes such as name of the
country or name of the city.
Those are string data types.
You can also look at population of a city
or a country.
Those are numeric data types.
But in addition to that, we also model
location
of the city or the footprint of a city.
And those are spatial data types.
So when we have attributes which are
geographically referenced, such as the
location, city
center, maybe specified by a longitude and
a latitude, perhaps even by its elevation.
So that is a spatial attribute.
Same way if we are looking the extent, the
footprint of a city.
Its outer boundary, or it, or a country.
Those are spatial attributes, okay.
So when we were working with spatial query
languages, we only
saw one specific representation of spatial
data what we call vector.
But in general, you know, there are more.
So, in spatial data mining you are
actually going
to see, you know, three different types of
data.
Okay?
The, the middle one, or the vector, is
something we saw with all
these data type, and we work with it in
spatial querying quite a bit.
And here is a map, which is showing you
a vector map, around the campus of
University of Minnesota.
So here we have a river, you know, roads,
you know, little buildings.
The buildings are you know, sort of, you
know, modeled
as polygons, roads are modeled as center
lines, and so on.
But you, you have also seen satellite
imagery, so if
you were on Google Earth, you can see the
raster version
of the same data, so here is University of
Minnesota
campus from a satellite imagery kind of
data set perspective, okay?
Something like what you will see on Google
Earth.
And this data set is a bit different.
So a raster data set is similar to what
you get from your digital camera.
Where, you know, okay, area is divided
into uniform grids, so
you can imagine columns and rows, and then
you have pixels.
So intersection of row and column is a
pixel.
So this entire data set may be composed of
1000 pixels in
each row and 1000 columns, so maybe there
is a million pixel.
And for each pixel, we may specify some
value
such as elevation or the reflectance, and
so on.
Okay?
So these are two very common data types,
and they're both used in spatial data
mining.
So for example in satellite imagery people
often start
from that, and they want to get land cover
types.
So which areas are forested?
Which are water?
And if one can do that for every year, you
can start to see the change.
You know, is a city growing, or is a
forest reducing, and so on.
Now there is a third data type called
graph.
In urban areas we have many transportation
network.
Okay, so when you use GPS based devices
for routing,
you are actually using these road maps in
a graph
format where road intersections may be
modeled as nodes, and
the road segments connecting adjacent
intersections may be modeled as edges.
And this kind of a format is very helpful
for routing and navigation.
Okay.
All right.
Now, one unique aspect of spatial data is
the relationships, okay?
So, let's again talk about relationships
across non-spatial and spatial data.
So, traditionally, if you have used
relational
databases, you have used their traditional
non-spatial relationships.
And they're always explicit.
In fact your database schema lists a set
of relationships, and which are
being stored in the data set, and that's
why we are calling it explicit.
So, in our own schema for spacial
querying, you remember that
cities and countries were related by a
relationship called capital of.
So certain cities were capital of their
countries, and this was explicitly stored,
okay.
In the table, if you remember, in the city
table there was a column which said
capital of.
And it had a country, so you were
explicitly storing it.
Now, contrast this with spatial
relationships, such as distance.
The city table that we saw, given the city
center locations,
we could call the [UNKNOWN] function and
compute the distance between cities.
Right?
However the distance was not explicitly
stored in the table.
Okay.
And this is very typical of spatial
relationships.
So these are implicit.
But you know you can compute it on demand
as long as all
the locations of geodata are using
compatible coordinate systems such as
latitude, longitude.
Okay, and there are many of these spatial
relationships.
So, in spatial querying chapter, we saw
topological relationships such
as you know, two countries boundaries,
they meet, they are neighbors.
Or, a city maybe within a country and so
on.
But, you know, there are other
relationships, such as direction.
So people who do navigation, they often
look
at absolute direction such as north,
south, east, west.
So for example, you can ask whether the
city, you know,
Toronto, in which direction is it from a
city like Mexico City.
Okay?
And based on these predicates you can just
say roughly
north, maybe a little bit to the east and
so on.
Okay?
There are metric relationships, such as
distance, areas and so on.
And if you got to raster data set, you
have other types
of relationships which are often
categorized
into focal, local and zonal, okay?
So focal relationships takes a location
and compares it with the neighborhood.
So if you imagine an elevation map given
in a raster format, then
given the elevation of each, you know,
cell or pixel in the roster,
we can compute the slope, we can ask if
you put the water
on this particular pixel, will it stay
there or it will flow down?
If it flows down which direction it will
flow down?
Okay, so these are called focal
relationships because
it's comparing a location with their
immediate neighbors.
People also define zonal relationships, so
given a raster data set and some kind of a
zone definition, such as country boundary,
you can ask for aggregate queries.
So let's say I have elevation data for
entire world and I have country boundaries
defining zones.
Then I can ask for the highest elevation
value for each country.
And that would essentially aggregate
elevation data or
pixels within each country to compute as
statistical aggregate.
So there is a rich side of these spatial
relationships.
They're all implicit, in other words, you
know, when you start with
a spatial data, you probably do not see
any spatial relationship there.
And, but if you want to add spatial
features and use
classical data mining model, you can use
these rich set of operators.
Okay, so distances are very, very popular.
People often use distance to
transportation or
distance to water in order to assess
the home value and so on, but you could
use other things like this.
You can ask for, you know, the elevation,
you know, the slope, and things of that
kind.
Now quick recall for the vector data type.
We did study this OGIS standard.
And you know, this provided you six data
types,
which has points, line strings, polygons
and their collections.
It also provided you these operations.
Now, these operations are very standard.
So, if you were using a product like you
know, post [UNKNOWN] PostGIS or you know,
other spatial libraries in Oracle and
Java, then
many of these functions are already
provided to you.
So if you were using these for your
spatial feature selection then your
programming effort is minimal.
Okay.
In fact many statistical software such as
SAS have built
a bridge to ESIRGIS software and they will
allow you to
compute even additional spatial features,
and bring them back in your
statistical environment as new features
for your statistical model building, okay?
And once your models are built, you can
just export them back
to ESIR your mapping environment to create
maps of your results, okay.
Now we are going to actually look at a
little bit more formal detail of this
topological operations.
You know, just to give you the sense of
the mathematical rigor behind it, this is
something we
didn't have time for in the spatial query
language,
but it's good for us to revisit a quick
minute.
So these topological operations in OGIS,
they are built on the
basis of a very nice
regressed mathematical framework called
topology, okay?
And in this case you know, they basically
you know, use three topological notion.
So if you have a let's say, a
country, topologically we can ask for
three different things.
What's the interior of the country, so
these are
all the places or locations which are
inside the country.
What's the boundary of this country, and
what's the exterior, things that are
outside.
So each country we can have three
topological property.
Now if I want to study relationship
between two countries
then I can look at the three topological
properties of
country B, three topological properties of
country A, and if
I look at all combinations I'm going to
get nine combinations.
And for each, we can look at the
intersection.
And that's what is called line
intersection model.
Okay?
So here in terms of notation, when you see
the superscript 0, that's the interior.
So here, this column, we are looking at
interior of B.
When you see delta, that's boundary.
So this is all boundary of B.
And minus sign is exterior.
This is exterior of B.
And same with interior of A, you know
boundary of A, and exterior of A.
So, if you look at these nine
combinations, in
each case we can ask whether they
intersect or not.
Just a boolean true false question, or a
zero one
question, that will allow us to formalize
this topological property.
So, for example, here when I am looking at
disjoint,
then here is your nine intersection model,
and what it
is telling is that the interiors don't
intersect, boundaries don't
intersect, and interior and boundary don't
intersect and so on.
So if you get this answer then that
relationship is disjoint.
On the other hand if I look at a
signature of this kind you notice
interiors don't intersect, okay.
But boundaries do intersect, remember,
this is the boundary.
So interiors don't intersect, but
boundaries intersect.
And this is the situation when you're
saying two countries are neighbors and so
on.
Okay?
So again these relationships are very
formally defined, so if you go use it in
PostGIS or Oracle, or you know IBM DB2 or
any Java libraries, and if you're using
OGIS kind of standard operations, your
results have
very rigorous, meaningful definition and
you can use
them to, to do your feature selection and
use classical data mining model if you
would.
Okay.
But in this course we'll show you other
models
which will take into account some of the
spatial properties.
Okay.
So with this we'll try to wrap up
the discussion of spatial data and feature
selection.
And the main thing is to say that at
least today, there is a simple features
module from OGC.
And that takes you quite far, but in
future, things will improve.
You know, right now OGC does not
model their directional predicate we
talked about.
It does not model three dimensional and
visibility relationships.
So if you are in an area where the
elevation varies, and you
want to ask what is visible from this
building top, or what is visible
from this particular window in a building,
those things are not built into OGIS,
and you have to do custom programming,
something like computer graphics to do
that.
Same way if you have spatio-temporal data,
such as GPS trajectory.
Those are not well supported in these
standards, and
we are going to see new standards and new
research
in, you know, coming out to give you more,
you
know clean ways or mathematically elegant
ways to model this.
Okay.
So this is, was a short discussion of
spatial data.
Again in summary, you know, we are going
to see many types of spatial data.
It could be raster which is a imagery just
like what you see from a digital camera.
This may be collected through a satellite
or
a UAV, and there is plenty of that data.
It may be a vector data.
So sometimes the satellite data, you know,
is hand processed and we identity lakes
or road boundaries, you know, road center
lines, and we create vectors, points,
lines, polygons.
And then finally, in urban areas, we also
model transportation networks as graphs.
And we are going to see all this data as
we proceed.
And these data sets again have
relationships.
A unique part of spatial relationship is
that they are implicit, so
you can compute them, they may not be
sitting in your table.
But there are quite a few of those
relationships and that will help you do
feature selection.
So with this we'll wrap up the discussion
of spatial data.
Next time when we come back we'll talk
about statistical
foundation, and what we need to change for
mining spatial data.
Thank you.
