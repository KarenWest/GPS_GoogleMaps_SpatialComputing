Hi folks.
We're back with our last video
in the cartography module.
As we discussed earlier in the module,
there's been a ton of innovation in
cartography in the past ten to 15 years,
much of it computing oriented.
In this video, we're going to go
over an area of innovation that I
think you'll find particularly compelling,
and that area is called spatialization.
The basic motivation for spatialization
is relatively straightforward, and
I'll walk you through it here.
So in this module we've looked at
all sorts of different thematic and
reference maps developed
using all sorts of
different interesting
cartographic techniques.
However these techniques are limited
in one critical way, and
that is that they only work with
geographically referenced data.
If data doesn't have
geographic references,
it's generally outside the reach
of traditional cartography.
As you can imagine, this began to get
a little frustrating for cartographers and
people in related fields like geography,
and this is where spatialization comes in.
There are two types of spatialization,
implicit spatialization and
explicit spatialization.
And we'll begin with the implicit version,
as that was the first type
investigated by cartographers.
Implicit spacialization began
with people figuring out ways to
represent very high dimensional
data sets in two dimensional space.
Now the classic application involves
taking some corpus of documents.
Say, for
instance all Wikipedia articles or, for
instance, all the documents
on your hard drive.
And representing these documents
as high dimensional bags of words.
Now if that doesn't make sense to you,
don't worry.
You really don't need to
understand this step to
understand implicit
spacialization overall.
Once we have these high dimensional
representations of our documents,
we can feed them into one of several
spacialization algorithms, for
instance, multi-dimensional scaling,
or a Kohonen self-organizing maps.
These algorithms then spit out
a visualization of your document corpus in
two dimensional space.
Documents that are more similar, and
this is critical, are closer together, and
documents that are less
similar are further apart.
Now that last sentence should
sound familiar, right?
Tobler's first law of geography, which Dr.
Shekar covered, states in part that
at least on the surface of the Earth,
near things are more related
than distant things.
Tobler's first law applies to real
geographic space, but what we,
what we've done using these spatialization
algorithms, is create an implicit
information space, whose properties
are similar to real geographic space.
Now since these implicit spaces
have geography-like properties,
cartographers figured out that
many of the same techniques we
have used in cartography,
work well in these spaces.
So for instance in a simple application
of cartographic spacialization,
we can actually carve up
the space into regions and
make a choropleth map to show
the number of documents in each region.
Cartographers have of course done
much more complex things with
implicit spatialization.
One of my favorite cartographic
implicit spatialization applications is
this one here.
In this spatialization,
doctors Andrea Skupin and
Sarah Fabrikant, visualized all
the abstracts from the annual meeting of
the Association of American Geographers,
using a self-organizing map.
Now you can see a large variety of
cartographic approaches being used,
including an isorhythmic layer,
which is similar to choropleth,
except it uses regions of similar
attribute values as its spatial units,
instead of things like counties,
states, and so on.
This visualization really gives
us a great understanding of
the landscape of geography.
At least at the time it was generated.
And you can see here that there
are a number of key words associated with
physical geography over here.
Surface temperature, precipitation,
these type of things.
Some geography of gender and
related topics over here, and
some urban geography over here.
So very recently, and
this is some late breaking news here.
An implicit spatialization of Reddit
communities was featured on Slate and
made some viral rounds
throughout social media.
Hopefully you saw this visualization.
Now in this spatialization, the 200
most popular topics on Reddit are shown
with the size of each region corresponding
to the popularity of the topic.
A choropleth approach likely
an unclassed choropleth approach,
is used to visualize the community
cohesiveness for each topic.
Okay, so that's implicit spatialization.
Let's talk briefly about
explicit spatialization now.
And to get that started let's
provide a little bit more context.
With implicit specialization,
we were dealing with data-driven
implicit reference systems.
Effectively, these reference systems were
made up by the spetialization algorithm,
to make more similar
things closer together.
That's how these spaces were arranged.
So as such, these reference systems
really have zero value in the real world,
outside of the specific visualization
in which they are used.
For instance this geography
visualization here isn't used for
anything, really can't be used for
anything but visualizing geography.
Explicit spatialization,
on the other hand is concerned with
using cartographic approaches and
other methods in spacial computing on real
life non-geographic reference systems.
For example as you can see here,
the periodic table.
Now my lab has done a lot
of work in this space, and
we actually define this term, but we'll
talk about that a bit in the next module.
The examples I want to go over in this
module were made by Dr. Kirk Goldsberry.
Avuh, geography professor
at Michigan State,
who's currently a visiting
professor at Harvard.
Kirk also has a rather
unique third position,
which he acquired solely through his
work in explicit spatialization, and
that is that he is a contributor,
interestingly,
to ESPN, which is the largest sports
cable channel in the United States.
So for instance here is an explicit
spatialization map Kirk did,
that shows the completion
percentage of NFL quarterbacks,
through various parts
of the football field.
With the football field here being
the explicit reference system
under consideration.
Now more red in this map indicates
higher completion rates, and
you can see that as you might expect,
the closer one gets to the quarterback,
the higher the completion rate.
And in general passes that
are closer to the center of
the field are completed more often
than passes towards the sideline.
And here's another one of Kirk's
explicit spatializations,
this time looking at basketball
which he generally focuses on.
Now in this map we're looking at
Dirk Nowitzki's shooting percentage, but
not on a, a football field obviously.
This time we're looking at a basketball
court explicit reference system.
Okay, so hopefully this video gave you an
idea of how cartography is being applied
to non-geographic data through the use of
explicit and implicit spatialization, and
more generally, hopefully this video
gave you a quick idea of some of
the computing-oriented innovation
going on now in cartography.
And with that, we've actually
wrapped up the cartography module.
I hope you've enjoyed
it as much as I have.
And I'll see you in the next module.
