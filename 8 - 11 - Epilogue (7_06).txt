Welcome back to the discussion
of spatial computing.
This week we are wrapping
up the discussions.
And I wanted to leave you know,
with just two small notes.
So the first this MOOC is just the,
a beginning of a journey
into spatial computing.
We touched upon about half a dozen topics
which are of very, very broad interest.
And, and they're quite significant
in terms of having societal impact.
But spatial computing has lot more topics.
If you are inclined mathematically,
there are very nice mathematical theories.
If you're inclined in
application oriented manner,
there are many applications as well.
So I did want to mention that
in the Coursera MOOC world,
there are other courses
on spatial computing.
Some from Penn State University,
ESRI has been planning one.
And as time goes by, I would believe, you
know, that it will be more proliferation.
In addition,
there are some very nice books,
so let me at least show
you a couple of those.
We at least use the first two, the top two
encyclopedia of GIS and spatial computing.
You saw a couple of articles in chapters
used, and those resources have a lot more.
The encyclopedia has over 200 articles,
and actually a second edition is
being developed,
which will have another 100 new articles.
The spatial database book, as you know,
has additional chapters on
spatial indexing on query processing, as
well as the mathematical foundations, and
this is written for a very broad audience,
it's used in many courses.
In addition you see other courses,
so here is a book by
Professor Michael Goodchild who
you met in one of the interviews.
And this is probably a very,
very popular book on GIS in general,
and gives you a broader perspective.
here, another book in the top sorry,
the bottom left,
you see a book by Michael Worboys, who
gives you a computing perspective on GIS.
So, he gets into algorithms.
You know, and other topics.
And, you know,
I see another book on spactal databases.
In fact, a new book on working with
you know, GPS trajectories and so on.
a, additional books, if you are really
into data structures I would refer you to
the book by professor You know,
it's a big book, but
really an encyclopedia on data structures.
You see a computational geometry book.
If you're algorithmically inclined,
you know,
there are whole semester-long courses and
this is a representative book.
You can continue on to statistics, and
there are books on spatial statistics.
In some universities, these are taught
within the Department of Statistics.
In other universities you may
have to go to Medical School,
Public Health,
other places to take these courses.
And so on, here you see epidemiology,
GIS in Health.
Continuing on,
you may be surprised even in business.
In fact, the top book here is co-author,
one of the co-author is Paul Krugman, and
some of you may recognize this name
from New York Times, a Nobel Laureate.
And his work in economics had to do with
spatial, essentially location of trade and
international trade, you know,
the transportation cost and so on.
And going across to you know,
further in social sciences, in psychology
people study spatial cognition.
How?
You know, most of us think about maps,
how we represent maps in our mind.
And coincidentally this year's
Nobel Prize actually went and it gave,
it explored GPS and brains, they showed
how rats can memorize maps and so on.
Okay?
So lots of different
intellectual discipline.
And the reason I am bringing
this out is the following,
you know a lot of this development is new.
You know, it's mostly since 1980s that a
lot of these major results have come, and
the interest has grown.
Because in order to study these topics
people needed lot more data and
computation or, you know,
other sensor systems like GPS.
And many of those were not available,
you know, till 1980s or 1990s, okay?
So it's a growing field and
I hope you will continue your journey and
you'll explore some of these topics.
And on the same front,
I also want to mention that you know,
since it's such a new field
that many people even
though they are using GPS
on their cell phone, okay.
They are using Google Maps, but it's still
you know, many people feel there isn't
much intellectual depth in this field
[LAUGH] because these topics are new, and
they haven't been taught around.
So, so it's important for all of us to
get involved in spreading the word.
You know, fair amount of
intellectual work has happened.
Courses are coming around,
books are coming around, and
it's up to all of us to spread the word.
So within you know, our support,
the stereotypes won't change.
So I was hoping, you know,
one of the key purpose of this goal is to
change people's attitude about
spatial thinking in general.
And you saw that many universities
have started creating GIS centers.
And again, you know if it is not happening
in your university, you should, you know,
take the lead and, and
try to to make a case.
Same way, evidence is emerging
that spatial thinking actually
predicts success in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics.
And in some universities,
all incoming engineering freshmen have to
actually take a survey of
about their spatial skills.
And they would again be surveyed at the
end of four years to see that, you know,
whether their spatial thinking skills
made a big difference in their success.
So again,
a lot of these things are happening, and
it's important if you're a part of
university or education to at least,
you know, think about those and
make a case to the leadership.
If you are in government again, you know,
government has been a key sponsor
of this kind of research.
It GPS came out of
the Department of Defense.
A lot of GIS work is sponsored by them.
National Science Foundation, NASA,
you know nowadays climate, environment,
they have all s, sponsored it.
However, often the support is fragmented.
You know, it's across many, many
disciplines, it's not a single place, and
it's important for the support to be
continued and probably consolidated.
So review panels maybe should
be formed around spatial.
So that all the proposals
are reviewed by people who
have some expertise in the field.
Okay?
And similarly in industry, you know,
once you go outside a few companies
like ESRI, or Oracle Spatial, or
maybe Google Maps, in many other
companies, spatial still is a niche thing.
You might find one person here,
one person there.
And when that happens they are fragmented.
They don't have a strong voice in
the company and the leadership.
In some companies, you will actually
see they took some initiative and
they have stepped back.
Right?
So, again,
it's important if you're working in,
in the industry is to institutionalize.
You know,
try to consolidate spatial skills and
expertise in a place and, and
articulate its value to the company.
Because as you know smart phones
are proliferating, you know,
any business that's affected by
a smartphone would probably,
would also be seeing spatial opportunities
whether it's connected cars in Detroit, or
you know it, it's something else.
But itâ€™s important again to advocate,
it should not be thought of as just yet
another application of
non-spatial thinking.
That doesn't take you far and I hope
that was a key message in the course.
So, we enjoyed, you know,
your presence in this course, on the
discussion and on various activities, and
we hope you will continue this
journey well beyond this course.
Thank you.
