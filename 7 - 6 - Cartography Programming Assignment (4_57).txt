Hello, folks!
Welcome to the second program
assignment of the University of
Minnesota's Spatial Computing MOOC.
In this assignment, we will have a real
exciting task, making your own map.
Of course I do not mean to
draw your map on a paper, but
instead make an interactive web-based map
using the latest state-of-art technology.
For this assignment,
we'll use TileMill and Mapbox.
With a technology used by
many larger companies like,
Foursquare, Pinterest and Evernote.
You have a chance to upload and
publish the map you made for
this assignment, online.
Which enables people from all
over the world to access your
map on both computers and mobile devices.
If you have already set up the VM for
our last program assignment,
you can keep using the VM as I have
already included TileMill in the VM.
Otherwise, you can visit the TileMill
website to download software.
You can just go to Google, search for
TileMill, and go to their website.
As you can see, the software
supports Windows, Linux, and Mac.
Also, TimeMill is a more mature software.
So setting up process is much easier
than however, as stated in the syllabus,
we cannot provide individual technical
support for the setting up process.
Now we are going back
to the virtual machine.
I opened the virtual box, and
I start the virtual machine.
[NOISE] Both our username and
password for the VM is special.
As you can see TileMill is on the desktop.
You just double-click it.
Now you're at TileMill.
TileMill comes with
a few example projects.
We'll open Open Street DC 1.
Now we're in the map developing
interface of TileMill.
On the left hand side, as you can see,
the preview of the map you are working on.
On the right hand side is the editor.
TileMill uses a styling language called
CartoCSS which looks familiar to those of
you who are familiar with CSS.
Don't worry if you know nothing about CSS
as CartoCSS will use in this assignment.
The is simple and
should not require any background in CSS.
You can click save at any
time to save your edits and
preview, preview your edits.
Let's see I'll just change
the color of water to red,
let's see, naw to, to white.
[NOISE] As you can see
the water used to be blue and
now it becomes white,
because I changed the color for water.
And after you have clicked save,
you can preview the edit you just made.
After we're done with editing it,
you can export your map to image file,
or envy tiles, which is a format that
allows you to publish your map on map box.
Now, we're going through the assignment.
Now, we're looking at
the programming assignment.
I'll skip the introduction.
You guys need to follow the instructions
very closely in order to
get the correct results.
Task one is more like a how to work
example that gets you familiar with
the TileMill environment and
the basic CartoCSS format.
You'll be working on the Washington D.C.
map example, which I just showed you,
to you guys.
Make sure you follow the instructions
closely and then answer questions.
Remember to save your work in order
to see an updated preview map.
[NOISE] Task two is my favorite one.
You have a chance to apply what you've
just learned about starting the map
using CartoCSS.
You are expected to make a really
ugly map, you can do that by
changing various elements, like the color
scheme, the fonts, and so forth.
Remember to save your map and
post it on the discussion form.
I'll start a new thread in the forum for
this purpose.
You won't be graded by
how ugly the map is,
as long you completed this task
you'll earn full points on this one.
For task three you'll make
an interactive thematic map
to visualize the poverty rate
in Twin Cities, Minnesota.
Again, make sure to follow
the instructions carefully.
After completing this task, you can also
try to visualize some other attributes for
other cities,
like your hometown, probably.
All right guys, you've now learned
the basic skills to make a web-based map.
I hope you guys enjoy this assignment.
If you are excited about making maps,
show some creativity.
Make your own map and
publish them on Mapbox.
Don't forget to share your
maps with us on the forum.
Have fun.
