Welcome back to the wrap-up session on
spatial data mining,
you know, with the sequence of last seven
videos of Saul.
We talked about what spatial data mining
is, and you know, what it is not.
We talked about different pattern
families,
we looked at statistical foundations, also
the
input data, and then we went into depth of
many many packing families.
Okay, so, at the end of this course, and
after you're done with all of your quizzes
and exams, maybe a year from now, what
should
you remember, you know, what's the take
away message?
Because it is a lot of details, and if
needed you can always
come back if you're working in the field,
to dig into the details.
But here are a couple of take aways that I
would like you to have.
Okay?
Geo-spacial data is different, you know,
it doesn't meet many,
many assumptions that you have with
classical data coming from internet.
So, you saw that even in the input part,
okay, there were things which were
different, for example relationships.
Many spacial relationships, like distance
or inside outside, they're implicit.
They have to be computed.
So, even if you're using classical data
mining,
and you want to select features from
spacial data.
Don't just look into what's already there
in the table, but think about
what are the relationships like distance
or insight are relevent to your problem.
And have a spacial software, you know,
either database or GIS computed
for you and then you could feed it into a
statistical package.
Also the types are different.
You remember points, lines, polygons,
[UNKNOWN]
These are more complex than numbers
and text and you have seen that in
previous chapter as well.
Okay?
The second, you should remember that the
statistical foundations are different.
In classical statistics, you know, for
simplifying their calculations.
They often made, you know, assumptions
like IID.
Learning samples are drawn independently
from
each other, they are from identical
distribution.
These assumptions are probably not true
for very many data sets, but certainly in
geographic data sets, these assumptions
are terrible,
and we showed you examples of that.
So again, you know, when you are analyzing
spatial data, don't
just use traditional methods like
linear regression, or Pearson correlation
coefficient.
Look at spatial or statistical ideas so
that
you take in to account spatial article
relation, okay.
And then finally, pattern families, and we
showed you
that you know, whether you are doing
association or
clusters, that patterns in space have
unique meanings and
you should look at techniques which
capture that meaning well.
If you don't, then your manual work
of post-processing will be a lot more
detailed.
So, hopefully you will remember that
geography data
is special, and it requires specialized
statistics, specialized
background families, and as long as you
remember that, I think we did a good job.
But you know, if you are diving into more
details, hopefully you will use
software available in MacLab and RTIS to
look at these techniques and working tips.
Thank you so much.
