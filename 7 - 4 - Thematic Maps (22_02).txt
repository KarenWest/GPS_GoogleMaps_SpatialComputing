Howdy, folks.
Welcome back to the Cartography Module.
The focus of this video is
going to be on thematic maps.
Recall that unlike reference maps, where
the goal is to geocommunicate the location
of specific entities,
the goal of thematic maps is to
geocommunicate the spatial
distribution of geographic attributes.
So for example,
in the election maps we saw earlier,
the goal is to communicate
the distribution of election results.
The goal of this news map is to
communicate the accessibility of
public transit.
And the goal of Menard's map
was to communicate the size of
Napoleon's army during his very
failed Russian campaign in 1812.
The structure of this video is
going to be pretty straightforward.
We're going to go through a number of
types of thematic maps, talk a bit
about how they're made, and discuss
their advantages and disadvantages.
Let's jump right in here and start
with what is almost certainly the most
commonly used thematic map these days,
which is the choropleth map.
What you're looking at right now is
a choropleth map with the percent of
the population in each U.S.
county that is below the poverty line.
In a choropleth map each spacial unit,
or a numeration unit,
in this case counties, is given
a single color in a range of colors.
The geographic variation of colors helps
the map user understand the spatial
distribution of the geographic attribute
in question, in this case poverty.
So for instance here it's pretty
easy to see that there's a,
a poverty pocket here in
the Mississippi Delta.
This has existed for many years.
It's a big problem we want to
fix in the United States.
There's a couple other poverty pockets
around here, and here, and here.
And, there's also a relatively
wealthy strip here, and,
in the northeast, where folks
have a decent amount more money.
Okay.
A major design challenge when
making a choropleth map,
arises out of representing data as colors.
Now in general this challenge
can be split up into two parts.
first, you have to decide on
the set of colors you will use.
And second, you have to decide how to
assign specific data values to each
color in the set you've chosen.
This is also known as data classification.
So let's start out here
with challenge number one.
Now in general, when deciding
the set of colors you will use for
choropleth mapping, the primary question
you have to ask yourself is whether your
spatial attributes are quantitative or
qualitative.
Okay.
So if your attributes are quantitative,
you're going to want your color scheme to
move smoothly from one color to another.
So in general, you want to go from
a color that seems lighter or
blander, to one that is darker or richer
as spatial attribute values get higher.
Now for those of you who know a little bit
about color, this amounts to low value and
low saturation for low spatial
attribute values and high value,
high color value, and high saturation for
high spatial attribute values.
You can see that we've used this type of
color scheme with a poverty map, because
percent of people below the poverty line
is of course a quantitative attribute.
Now other quantitative attributes that you
might find mapped include, for instance,
a population density and a people per
square mile as you see here on this map,
and percent of the population that is 85
years old or older which is shown here.
Now when you're dealing
with quantitative data,
it's almost always a bad idea
to use hue or more colloquially,
use different colors to represent
different values of spatial attributes.
Now this is something that naive
map makers very frequently do and
it almost always results
in terrible thematic maps.
So for example,
we're turning to our poverty map here.
If I had used hue or again,
a lot of people refer to this as
different colors to represent each data
value, you can see it's much harder to
understand the distribution and the
variation of poverty in the United States.
So for example, I don't know is brown
you know, more or less than red?
Is green more or less than orange?
Is gray more or less than brown?
These types of things.
It's very difficult to
understand the distribution of
poverty around the United States and
this is very intuitive to understand.
In fact, I call it drop dead obvious
in the map in which our color scheme is
appropriate for a quantitative attribute.
There is one important exception
to the don't use hue for
quantitative data in choropleth maps rule.
And that exception is
divergent color schemes.
Now proper uses of divergent color
schemes generally involve the mapping of
data that has logical poles.
Now these poles can arise either because
you want to emphasize the extremes of
the distribution of the attributes that
you're mapping, or because more of
one something inherently means less
of something else in your attributes.
A note here that the,
the arrows here go in both directions,
so this way is higher values and
this way is, is higher values deviating
from some sort of center point here.
Now the most famous example of
the use of divergent color schemes in
the United States are the election
maps we see during pretty much every
election these days.
Now more blue, of course,
means more Democratic and less Republican.
And more red means more Republican,
and less Democratic.
Okay, so that's what you do to
decide your color scheme for
quantitative spacial attributes.
What about qualitative attributes,
like, for instance, land cover type,
urban versus forest versus water,
the primary religion in an area,
the primary language spoken in an area,
the region of an area,
like the East Coast ,West Coast,
Midwest, and so on, and so forth?
Now, unlike was the case with
quantitative data, for these and
other qualitative attributes,
varying hue is actually the way to go.
So you do want to vary hue.
So for instance, let's return to this map
of what football game is playing on TV
on one particular week earlier this year.
This is a qualitative spatial attribute,
and, and
it is properly visualized
using variations and hue.
You can see, for instance,
that places where the New Orleans versus
Atlanta game is plain, it's in red.
Buffalo versus Chicago in blue.
Minnesota versus Saint Louis in yellow,
go Vikings, and so on and so forth.
Because this is qualitative data,
you don't want to emphasize spatial
attribute variation using value in
saturation, like you would want
to do with a quantitative data.
If the map maker here had done this,
for instance, as I've mocked up here,
it would be more difficult to
see which game is playing where.
And more importantly,
it implies quantitative variation for
instance this implies like maybe
some games are playing, you know,
more intensely than others, some games are
louder, or something along these lines.
It's pretty obvious that a varying
hue is the way to go here.
Okay, we've addressed the first challenge
associated with choropleth maps by
discussing what kind of color scheme,
what kind of color scale we need for
quantitative spacial attributes and
for qualitative spacial attributes.
So let's move on to the second challenge,
which is about optimally mapping colors
to specific attribute value ranges.
So we already have our color scheme.
Now we have to figure out which
attribute values go with which colors.
So for example here,
why did I choose right,
to map this color here as this range,
0 to 11.3% below the poverty line and
this color here to this range,
and so on and so forth?
Now performing this color mapping
is known as data classification.
And there are a number of
approaches to doing so.
The highest level distinction
between approaches is that between
classed maps and unclassed maps.
Classed maps use color bends like
I've done with our poverty map, and
are the traditional, and are still I'd
say by far the most common approach.
Unclassed maps use a color
spectrum rather than color bends.
Unclassed maps are growing in popularity.
And thanks to interactive mapping
technologies, they're becoming more and
more legitimate in the eyes
of many practitioners and
researchers of cartography.
Now here's an example of an unclassed map,
courtesy of indiemapper.com.
You can see that rather
than showing color bends,
the legend shows a spectrum
from high to low.
Now the advantage of unclassed maps is
that they don't generalize data at all.
The disadvantage though, and
this is a serious one is that humans have
a hard time of distinguishing between
more than five different color values.
We know this from an extensive
amount of research.
Now, because classed maps are still
the most common approach we're going to
focus on classed maps for the remainder
of our discussion of choropleth maps.
The advantage of unclassed maps,
is they don't generalize the data at all.
This disadvantage is that, humans have a
hard time distinguishing between more than
five different color values.
We know this from an extensive
amount of research.
Now there's a big debate between
classed maps and unclassed maps.
But because classed maps are still
the most common approach, I decided to
focus in more depth on classed maps
rather than unclassed maps for
the remainder of our discussion
of choropleth mapping.
Now if you are looking at a classed map,
or if you decide to make one,
you have a number of different
options to choose from.
For instance, there are natural breaks
class maps, there are quantile class maps,
there are equal interval class maps,
there are standard deviation class maps.
And there are many, many,
many, many more types of class maps, and
we're going to go over a few of these.
In my view,
these are what you see most often.
So we'll focus on these.
So natural breaks of those three is
probably the most commonly used approach,
and it's the one that is actually employed
by default in a popular geographing
information system software like Arc GIS,
if any of you are familiar with
that it's piece of software.
Now, roughly speaking, natural breaks
takes the histogram of attribute values in
a given special data layer,
finds natural co natural clusters, and
makes the color bin boundaries
enforce those clusters.
Now, the primary advantage to natural
breaks is that it is a lightweight
data-driven way to surface these natural
clusters in your spatial distribution.
Now this is particularly powerful
when there are outliers in the data.
So for instance, here is the histogram for
the population density map we saw earlier.
It's hard to tell, but
there are a few values here that
are huge outliers, and this is
captured by the natural breaks algorithm
in that these values have their own class.
interestingly, all of these
outliers are in New York City,
with Manhattan, which is also known as New
York County, having the highest density.
The first non New York City
county is San Francisco County,
which has a much smaller population
density, and it's in the second class.
In this way, Natural Breaks really
captured well the qualitatively different
levels of density that occur in New
York City relative to everywhere else in
the country.
And because of this so
does our Natural Breaks based map.
Quantile in another quite common data
classification approach for class maps.
Quantile's pretty straightforward.
Let's imagine we have a spatial dataset
that has a single attribute value for each
US state, which I visualized here on this
slide using some made-up attribute values.
The quantile classification approach
involves first sorting the attribute
values, as I've done here.
And it then goes through the list, putting
the same number of enumeration units in
each class, so
the same number of states in each class.
So if we want to have five classes,
as we have before as we
have throughout this lecture that means
we're going to have ten enumeration units,
ten states in the first class.
And these are the top
ten by attribute value.
The second class has
the second to top ten the ten
through twenty highest attribute
values and so on and so forth.
Quantile is a great technique to use
when you're interested in the order of
attribute values, rather than
the specific values themselves.
So, for instance, let's say we want to
see which parts of the country have
higher population densities, and which
parts of the country have lower densities.
But we're not actually that interested in
the specific density values themselves.
Now, in this case,
we wouldn't want to use natural breaks
like in this map, but rather we'd want to
use the quantile classification
like we have here in this map.
Now rather than highlighting how much of
an outlier New York City and a few other
major cities are relative to the rest of
the country, this map reveals different
patterns and patterns that are equally
interesting and, and equally important.
So for instance, in this map we can see
how incredibly sparsely populated much of
the Northern Great Plains is,
relative to the rest of the country.
This map also highlights the unbroken
streak of relatively high population
density in the Northeast, a region that
geographers sometimes call Megalopolis.
Now while there are a number of other
less commonly used data classification
approaches, the last approach we're
going to cover in this video, and
one that is quite commonly used,
is the equal interval approach.
Now this approach is very simple.
You take the highest attribute value,
subtract from it the lowest
attribute value, and divide by that,
divide that by the number of classes,
which has been five for us, and
this gives you your class width.
So for example,
here is the histogram for poverty rates
with equal interval class breaks.
You can see here that these class breaks
are exactly the same distance apart,
which is what we've expect
with equal interval.
So, data classification in
cartography is a wonderful tool.
But like many tools,
it can also be used for evil.
And specifically, a data classification
is a great way to lie with maps.
And let me show you what I mean by
using the map of the percent of
the population that is above the age
of 85 we saw earlier in the video.
Now, let's suppose I'm a real estate
agent of dubious character and
I'm trying to sell houses in
the Northern Great plains here.
Now, to do this I decided I needed
to make this area look younger and
hipper because there are so many people
around here that are above the age of 85.
It's going to be hard to get people who
are in the housing market to buy houses.
Now what we're visualizing
this map with is,
is the natural breaks
classification approach.
Natural breaks is going to reveal
the natural clusters in the data,
including that there is a large cluster
of high proportion 85 plus counties in
the northern Great Plains.
Now although this cluster exists in real
life, as a real estate agent this is
not going to help me sell houses in
this region, so I go into my mapping
software real estate is a common place
where you see spatial computing employed.
So I go into my mapping software, and
I decide play around a bit to see if
there's a classification
approach that meets my goals.
And remember these
are very dishonest goals.
I try several different
classification approaches and
I settle on equal interval because
it makes the region I am looking to
sell houses in look quite a bit younger.
Now in this case equal
interval is affected by
some enormous outliers here which
you can see in these two arrows.
And this makes the class width,
if you recall our equal interval equation,
much wider.
As such, values that are at much
higher classes in the first map,
are in lower classes in this map, which
why everything looks much lighter green.
Now, what I should have done,
as a real estate agent,
is choose the data classification approach
that best represents the data for
the map reader, or the map user's needs.
Now in this case that's helping them
see that the Great Plains is an aging
region with a high
proportion of people 85 and
older relative to the rest
of the United States.
There are purposes for which equal
interval is appropriate, of course.
But in this case it obfuscates
the important patterns in the data for
this map purpose.
The purpose of teaching you about lying
with maps using data classification
is twofold.
First and foremost, hopefully now you
can be a more educated a map reader and
make sure to examine the map
legend over here to see if
there's any funny business going on.
Now this is actually the only
way to suss out folks who try to
lie with maps using data classification.
Second, for any of you that make maps, and
for those of you in the technical track
who will make a map for this for
the assignment for this module.
Hopefully this was reminder, this was a
reminder to use your map making skills for
good, and not evil.
Okay, the last thing I want to
say about mapping data values to
colors in choropleth maps, is to briefly
address this for qualitative attributes.
Now fortunately for these attributes, it's
a lot easier than quantitative attributes.
The most important thing
that you have to do,
is to make sure that the colors you
choose won't be misinterpreted as
being quantitative in nature in
the manner we discussed earlier.
Now another concern is to make sure you
chose colors that are color blind safe,
and to do so
I'd recommend using ColorBrewer, which is
a tool that has become incredibly popular,
both inside of cartography and
these days outside of it as well.
In fact its creator, ColorBrewer's
creator academic cartographer Dr.
Cynthia Brewer, at she's a professor
at Penn State University.
She was recently featured in Wired
magazine, which is pretty exciting to see.
ColorBrewer will give you qualitative
color schemes for a given number of
classes that are color-blind safe, and
safe for a number of other uses as well.
You'll see that you can
also use ColorBrewer for
regular quantitative color schemes, and
for diverging color schemes as well.
And in fact all the maps I made for
this lecture,
I used color schemes from ColorBrewer.
Okay, so, that was a pretty long
exposition on choropleth maps.
Fortunately a lot of what we've learned
about choropleth maps also applied to
these other two types of maps, and
it was worth spending additional time on
choropleth maps because they're probably
the most common type of map you'll see out
there on the internet today, for instance.
So next up, we have graduated and
proportional symbol maps.
These maps are also based around
enumeration units like counties, but
they use symbols rather than color
to communicate the distribution of
spatial attributes.
So for example here is a graduated symbol
map of the population of each county in
the United States.
You can see that in the in the legend, the
larger the symbol placed in the center of
each county, the more populous the county.
You'll note that I used squares here and
this was intentional.
Graduate symbol maps are about
using size rather than color to
represent the distribution
of spatial attributes, and
humans are much better at perceiving the
relative areas of squares than circles.
Like was the case with color and
choropleth maps,
deciding how to map between size and
attribute values is a key challenge in
graduated and proportional symbol maps.
So here there are also two
high level approaches.
Proportional symbol maps
use the unclassed approach.
And graduated symbol maps
use the classed approach.
The same data classification
methods apply for
graduated symbol maps as they as they
did for class choropleth maps, but
here we're talking about
symbol size instead of color.
Graduated and
proportional symbol maps have certain
advantages over choropleth maps.
In particular they use size instead of
color to visualize the variation in
spacial attributes.
And recent research has shown that size
may be preferable to color in, for
a number of purposes.
Now that said graduated and proportional
symbol maps also have some disadvantages,
namely the symbols can
overlap extensively for,
preventing people from seeing
numeration units of interested.
For example, definitely here it
is difficult to see any sort of
individual numeration unit,
any individual county in this cluster
of northeastern counties there.
Varying size rather than color can also
be confusing for proportional attributes,
like population density, percent of
the population that is over 85, and so on.
Graduated and proportional symbol
maps are better for raw values,
which of course is a bit confusing because
of this term proportional being used for
proportion symbol maps.
But proportional values are best
shown on choropleth maps.
Okay, the next and
the last type of thematic graph that I
want to discuss is the cartogram,
and this is a fun one.
To understand cartograms let's take a look
at this map of the 2012 United States
presidential election, states Barack Obama
won are of course in blue, and
states Mitt Romney won are in red.
Now even though Barack Obama
won the election,
this map in some ways suggests
that Mitt Romney did.
Namely more of the United States here is
covered in red than is covered in blue.
The reason this is the case is that
many of these big red states have
very little population, and
because the United States is a democracy,
these states count less than
smaller states like Massachusetts.
Which actually has 11.5 times
the population of Wyoming over here,
even though it's a much smaller state.
Now, cartergrams are designed
to address this issue.
They alter the geometry of enumeration
units, like counties and states and so on.
And they do so
according to an attribute of interest.
These new shapes can then be
used to show a choropleth map.
For instance, here's the same map but
in cartogram form.
Each state has been changed in
area to roughly correspond to
the state's population or at least
to their number of electoral votes.
You can see here that Wyoming
has gotten a lot smaller and
Massachusetts has gotten a lot bigger.
Other large population states
like California New York,
Florida, these states have
also gotten a lot larger.
You can see here with a quick glance at
the map that it's easier to tell that
Barack Obama won the election, because
there's more area in blue than in red.
And this is of course different than
if we used a regular, a geographic map.
You've already seen an example
of a cartogram in this course.
When we were looking at how central
each country of the world is to all of
encyclopedic world knowledge as
defined by the Japanese Wikipedia,
we saw this choropleth map.
I then showed you what this would look
like if each country was sized by
how central it is.
Now in this case, I've used the cartogram
to support through redundancy
the information encoded in the choropleth
map, rather than to show a different
attribute, like we did with the electoral
votes in the previous example.
This is also another proper
way to use a cartogram.
In general, cartograms can enhance
a choropleth map quite a bit in
certain cases.
But they have obvious disadvantages,
namely they distort, space extensively.
Japan of course is not actually this big,
and that's going to confuse some people.
Now in practice cartograms
are rarely presented alone,
instead they appear with non distorted
core plus maps with an option for
users to click over to
the cartogram version.
So for instance, in the lead up to
the 2012 election The New York Times had
this interactive
visualization on its website.
You can see another type of cart,
of cartogram here.
But you also can click over to
the regular geographic view here.
Okay.
So we've been through the three
types of thematic maps I wanted to
talk about today.
Which is unfortunately all we can do in
this short video on thematic cartography.
There are of course, other types of
thematic maps and there are many of them.
For instance we have dot maps here.
We have heat maps.
My quick hint with heat maps is that
they're really hard to pull off well and
I'd actually avoid using them if possible.
If you do, at least don't use
hue in the typical fashion.
As this is of course inappropriate for
quantitative variables which is actually
which are actually being visualized here.
There are also flow maps which allow
you to visualize what are called
geographic dipoles or attributes that
are connected to two places not just one.
There are many other types of maps as
well but those will have to wait for
a full course on cartography.
For now, that's it for
thematic cartography and
I'll actually see you in the next video.
