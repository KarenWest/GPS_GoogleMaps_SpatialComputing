Welcome back to the Positioning Module.
Now, in the last video we talked about
how positioning techniques can be
split into two categories, signal-based
and content-based positioning.
Now, in this video we're going to
begin our discussion focusing on
signal-based positioning.
Now among many, many,
many other important applications,
signal based positioning is how your
smartphone knows where you are.
It's through signal based positioning
that your smartphone can provide that
little blue dot that you see in mobile
map applications like Google Maps and
the Apple Maps app.
It's also through signal-based positioning
that your smartphone can determine
the correct latitude and longitude
coordinate with which to tag an Instagram
photo or a Tweet or other forms of social
media volunteered geographing information.
And although it's less visible,
signal-based positioning is also key in
helping us excuse me helping
location-based services determine what's
nearby in apps like Yelp,
Foursquare, and so on.
Now, you can see here that Yelp is telling
me that the very delicious restaurant,
Bun Mee Sandwiches, is on,
is only 0.1 miles from my current
position at the time which was my office.
Now this is one reason that if I end up
recording additional videos, perhaps for
a second offering of this MOOC,
I might appear a little bit heavier.
Of course signal-based
positioning does more than
just help professors fatten themselves up.
And, more generally know,
help smartphones know where they are.
so, for instance, signal-based
positioning is used by scientists to
help track migratory species, it's used by
farmer to implement optimal strategies for
their crops, and it's used many, many,
many more applications in public
safety and so on and so forth.
Now there are a number of signal-based
positioning strategies that are in
common use, but the three most employed
types are satellite based positioning,
Wi-Fi positioning, and cellular
positioning, or cell tower positioning.
There are two names for that.
Now in this video we'll look in more
detail at satellite based positioning, and
we'll handle the other
two in the next video.
Okay.
The formal name for
a satellite based positioning system is
a global navigation satellite system.
Although I will note
that not all GNSS's or
global navigation satellite
systems are global.
And I'll get to that in a bit.
Now, as you might have guessed, the most
well-known and the most utilized global
navigation satellite system is
the Global Positioning System or GPS.
GPS has a very interesting history.
At a high level, it was, and it actually
still is, a U.S. government technology.
It's run by the U.S. government.
And it's definitely a product of
the Cold War between the United States and
the USSR.
Now those of you who know your Cold War
history know that the USSR launched
Sputnik I.
The first man made satellite in 1957.
Now this scared the bagebbies
out of most Americans and
the US government at the time.
And some American physicists, as a result,
were assigned to locate
Sputnik as it orbited Earth.
And through that process,
they realized that they could use
Sputnik's radio signals to do this.
And this got folks thinking about
maybe doing the reverse, right,
using satellites for
positioning here on Earth,.
Rather than trying to locate a satellite.
Now over the next decade or
two, the technology necessary for
doing this process, using satellites for
positioning here on Earth, was developed
by the United States military for
missile targeting and for
a number of other military applications.
Now this technology evolved to
become the GPS system we know today.
The transition of GPS from a purely
military technology to a civilian one
began when the USSR shot down
Korean Airlines Flight Seven when it
drifted into Soviet airspace in 1983.
Ronald Reagan who was the president of
the United States at the time instructed,
after that pretty famous incident, we
heard a little bit more about that summer,
right, when The, the Malaysian Airlines
flight went down over Ukraine.
After this,
this Korean Airlines in, incident,
Ronald Reagan instructed that the GPS
system move towards public availability.
But this didn't happen until
the year 2000, fully at least,
because prior to that year,
the GPS signal was actually degraded so
that just the military could have
access to the precise positioning.
That we actually all have
on our smartphones today.
Now in 2000, Bill Clinton removed this
intentional signal degradation which
was called selective availability.
Now this single order by Bill Clinton
has made possible so many of
the applications of positioning that we
discussed at the beginning of this video.
And we'll continue discuss,
to discuss throughout the module.
Now because of this history I like
to think of Ronald Reagan and
Bill Clinton as GPS B, BFFs.
Even though they had many many
political disagreements Reagan and
Clinton realized the power and
importance of positioning in
civilian applications and they both
are responsible for making that possible.
Okay.
So how does the global
positioning system work?
Well it consists of 24 satellites,
plus a few extras.
All of which are on a fixed 12
hour orbit around the earth.
Each satellite transmits radio
signals at fixed intervals, and
these radio signals
are used by GPS devices,
like a smartphone, in a prositioning
approach called trilateration.
Now at a high level
trilateration works like this.
Let's say that you and your smartphone
are located in this big white abyss here.
Let's just pretend it's a snowy field,
right?
And let's say that you and
your smartphone can see this satellite.
Now when I say see,
I mean it's just in the line of sight.
GPS does require roughly speaking
line of site which means that if,
you can’t see the sky chances are your
smartphone can’t see the sky,
and that also means, your smartphone
won’t be able to see the GPS satellites.
Now if your smartphone can detect signals
from the satellite if it’s in the line of
site of the satellites.
It can actually relatively easy,
easily calculate the distance between
the satellite and the smartphone or
any other GPS device, of course.
And it does this by just figuring out the,
the difference in time between when the,
when a signal leaves the satellite and
when it is received by the smartphone or
other GPS device.
And with time and
the speed of light which is the, the speed
at which the GPS signal travels, right?
It's pretty easy to
determine the distance.
But just knowing the distance from one
satellite won't help you much, right?
Because you could be anywhere that is
that distance away from the satellite.
And although this of course
operates in three dimensions.
I've simplified things here down to two.
And so basically if you are a certain
distance away from the satellite,
you could be anywhere on this circle,
right?
So the good news here is if you can see a
second satellite, things get a lot better.
Because if you can calculate
the distance from that satellite there.
At least in the simple in the,
in the simplification.
Excuse me.
There becomes only two places
where you can be, right?
And those two places are the two places
where these two circles intersect.
And if you can see a third satellite,
well your position is now resolved.
And, indeed, for GPS to work,
your GPS device, or your smartphone.
Needs to find at least three
satellites for just an x, y coordinate.
Excuse me, an, an x, y position,
a latitude and longitude position, and
if you're going to do altitude as well,
you'll need a fourth satellite.
And in general, the more satellites
you have with GPS, the better.
Public access to GPS was a complete
positioning game-changer.
Prior to its availability.
People were pretty much on their own.
When it came to figuring out
exactly where they were.
And for
those of you who are my age or older.
You definitely remember how incredibly
difficult this could be sometimes.
Now for scientists and professionals
the situation was actually even worse.
Obtaining an accurate latitude and
longitude coordinate.
Which is needed for so
many different applications.
This was a very expensive process and
it required people with
a great deal of training.
However, even though it's a complete
game changer in positioning GPS is
definitively not perfect.
So for instance, unless you're watching
this move while sun tanning somewhere,
chances are that GPS is
actually failing you right now.
One of GPS' key disadvantages is
that it does not work indoors,
although this is changing a little bit.
But for the part with current technology
you can assume that GPS will not
work if you can't see the sky.
If your smartphone can't
see the satellites, right?
Another limitation of GPS is that it's
accuracy can be somewhat limited for
certain applications.
For most location based services that we
talked about so for instance Yelp, right?
GPS is totally fine.
But if you're going to want to do
something with a lot of precision like for
instance map a gas line or something like
that where you definitely want to make
sure you have that that gas line's exact
latitude and longitude coordinate.
A series of latitude and
longitude coordinates or
else something bad could happen.
You're not going to want to
use a GPS in a smartphone.
You could get more expensive GPS equipment
that is quite a bit more accurate,
uses a bunch of different
correctional approaches.
But for the purposes of smartphone GPS
the accuracy could be somewhat limited.
The time to first fix can
be challenging with GPS.
What this means is, effectively, it's the
time that the GPS needs to see three or
more satellites.
And this, this can be slow.
It's aided by a number of
different technologies but
it still is not instantaneous.
Another key limitation in GPS is that
line of sight can be really blocked in,
a highly urban downtown areas.
This is called the multifa,
the multipath effect.
Or somebody will call
these multi path issues.
So basically what this means is that if
you're in an urban canyon like the one you
see here this was taken from the the CN
Tower, that's the name of it in Toronto.
chan, your GPS is going to have a hard
time finding the satellites because
the whole view of the sky right, is
blocked by these enormous tall buildings.
So GPS has a limitation there.
Now finally an important
limitation of GPS especially in
a smartphone context is that it
can be a big drain on power.
So these are these are a number
of important limitations of GPS.
And we will be returning to these
limitations in the next video.
Before we get to that next video I want
cover one more important thing and
that is this.
We have added another bBFF
to our series of BFF.
Why is that?
Well because GPS is not alone
now in terms of operational and
usable global navigation
satellite systems.
The Russians, actually, launched their,
own, they finished it up in 2011.
It's called GLONASS and actually
many modern smartphones use GLONASS.
So, for instance, I have an iPhone 5.
My I phone five not only looks for
GPS satellites now it also looks for
GLONASS satellites.
And this has a number of benefits
once again I said the the more
satellites the more accurate right?
It also could be that for instance some
GLONASS satellites are in your line of
sight faster than for
instance GPS satellites.
So, your phone is able to
establish a position faster.
Now there are a number of other,
Global Navigation Satellite Systems
that will be completed relatively soon.
One is the Galileo system
from the European Union, and
another is the BeiDou system from China.
Okay, that is it for,
Global Navigation Satellite Systems.
We'll continue in the next video
with wi-fi positioning and
cell tower positioning.
