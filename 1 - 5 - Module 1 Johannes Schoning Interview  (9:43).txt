Hey folks, welcome back to the University
of Minnesota Spacial Computing MOOC.
The last thing we're going to do in
the first module is talk with a series of
experts in the spacial computing field.
And the first expert we're going to
talk to is Dr. Johannes SchÃ¶ning.
He is a professor of computer science
at Hasselt University in Belgium,.
And let's welcome Yohannes
here in via Skype.
Hi Yohannes.
>> Hey Brand, how are you doing?
>> Good.
So we have a series of questions for
you today.
The first thing I want to ask is,
can you tell me a bit about
your research interests?
>> Yeah, sure, of course.
So in, in general,
my research interests are new and
novel interfaces to interact and
navigate through spatial information.
So what does it mean?
So let's make this thing
a bit more concrete.
So as I've said,
in general I'm interested to design,
develop, and test user interfaces.
That help people to to solve
their daily task more,
more efficiently or more enjoyable.
For example, you know a standard problem,
navigating from A to B.
And my work really includes
the development of, of various types of
different user interfaces, ranging from
mobile augmented reality interfaces.
For example, my, in my early work,
I combined the advantages of,
of the paper map with the advantages
of of, of the mobile device.
By using the mobile device like a,
like a magic lens over the paper map.
As I, I still think that paper
maps are still superior to
their digital counterparts in,
in several ways.
And with that the magic lenses of reality
approach we combine the advantages of both
medium, but as I said its not just only
magic reality its a range of different
user interfaces, interactive surfaces, and
tabletops, and post desktop interfaces.
Yeah that's more or less in a nutshell my,
my main research interests.
>> Great Yohannes, now I was wondering
if you could tell us how you
began working in the spacial
computer domain.
>> Mm-hm.
Yeah, well as as I said,
I studied geoinformatics at
the University of Muenster in, in Germany.
And the institute for geoinformatics
there is one of the leading institute in,
in that area, in the world.
And geoinformatics is an interdisciplinary
and a very interesting subject,
between computer science, and
all the other geoscience.
And yap,
that's how I dived into into the research.
And of course you know,
before that, before studying
geoformatics I'm addicted to maps.
I was addicted to maps before,
I enjoy to hike and climb high mountains.
So, take the maps our and are still mine.
My daily com companions and therefore, of
course I was attracted for such an very,
very interesting interdisciplinary study
area like, like [INAUDIBLE] informatics.
>> You and I both have that in common.
We both were, were big math nerds
before getting into this field, yeah.
I suspect that many of you were as well.
Okay, let's move on to the next question.
What do you think has been the most
important new spatial technology, or
research paper over the past two or
so years.
>> Okay, that's, that's a tough question.
Of course.
>> It is a tough one.
[LAUGH].
>> Yeah.
There was a lot of stuff, but for me, for
me a really, really interesting and
influencing point was the release of
Google Earth now like nine or
ten years ago.
I was still an undergrad
student at this time.
That's as far I can, as I can remember.
But, I was amazed how simple it could
be to develop the user interface
that gives the user the power to access
satellite data from all over the globe.
So while being, you know, while
studying geoinformatics, you know, I,
we, we worked with, like,
highly complex commercial GIS systems.
And it was always very,
very hard to integrate, like,
satellite data from different sources,
or even get hold of the satellite data.
And Google Earth was really,
really like a turning point in,
in that, it was really a big step
forward providing the really an easy and
intuitive user interface to access,
to access a rich amount of,
of rusta spacia, spacial information.
And also, the technology itself,
you know, it's, it's a globe, and
if you put the, put the,
put the satellite data on,
the technology itself, I think,
it's not very, very complicated.
I really think that this simple idea was
really one of the breakthroughs of, of,
geoinformatics, or spacial computing in
the last I would say, in the last decade.
And it also, it, it brought the power
of spatial information, to the users.
This, I think, was also an,
an important point.
>> Yeah, I remember you did some very
interesting work going back I guess
seven or eight years where you projected
Google Earth onto a wall-size display.
well, actually on a wall
using a projector, right?
And you were,
you were interacting with that,
with a all sorts of
interesting techniques.
I think I recall you do,
doing one where you're able to turn
the Earth with your nose, is that correct?
>> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH]
>> It was just, you know, right?
It was a fun project.
It was a fun project.
And now, you know, it dates back to 2005.
We were also, you know, I'm not sure
if the course, audience is familiar,
is the work of Jeff Han,
he had a famous Ted Talk,
presenting his technique to realize
a large multi-touch surface.
We picked up that that idea of FDIR
that he brough back in 2005, 2006, and
of course, you couldn't interact with
a virtual globe with your hands,
and feet and also with the nose.
But of course, mainly we use our hands-
>> [LAUGH]
>> to direct with spatial information.
Actually, we, we did not work with,
with Google Earth.
It was not a Word Wine.
>> Oh, that's right, that's right.
>> the, the, the virtual globe of,
of, of [INAUDIBLE] and
of the Google Earth product.
We call this, the [INAUDIBLE]
it's far more open that you have,
a better chance to,
to interface with, with it.
>> That's right.
I recall that now.
So, moving on to the next question.
What is the project that you're working
on right now, that gets you most excited?
Of course tons of stuff is
going on at the moment we
are right before an important deadline.
>> [LAUGH]
>> And I'm, I'm,
I'm working on various project.
And I guess I could fill up you know,
the whole course with all
the project I'm working on.
But let's take like two,
three recent example.
One example I would like to mention is for
the map project, it takes back a couple
of years ago, and for the photo map was
a mobile application that helps
user to snap a photo of a map,
and then geo-reference that photo of
the map on the fly meaning you assign,.
We would coordinate to the pixels of
the photo of the map and then you can use
that photo of a public map that you found,
you know, in, in a park or
wherever you, you walk around,
you can use that photo for navigation.
And this was proved a very,
very useful application for the user.
So this was one,
one a recent project, which also,
you know, contained a very, you know,
simple idea, but it was quite powerful.
A second one I would like to mention,
it's a very,
very recent one, we're currently working
on how to print maps to smart watches.
I guess we have seen the keynote, a few,
a few days ago from Apple they are
presenting their smart watch interface.
And here the challenge is from the human
computer interaction points are that you
have a very, very tiny display, and
very, very limited interaction.
And we currently working on
different to explore different
visualization ma, methods.
To bring maps back to such a tiny wrist
worn device like, like the Apple watch.
And maybe the third one a fun
one is our a social hiking app.
So you know
>> That is a fun one.
[LAUGH].
>> I told you before I love going to
the mountains, I love the woods, and
the a social hiking app is a mobile
application again that helps people first.
We have a desktop client
to help people to find
routes that are more likely to be
lonely roots through the words.
So, we analyze, you know, open speed map
data, we analyze Flickr information to
get information whether a root is
more likely to be lonely or not, and
then we also have a mobile prototype and a
mobile extension, where we use network and
technology to also try to sense
if cohikers are nearby or
approaching you to give you a warning
to still feel alone on your hike.
For me, a very,
very important application to escape from,
from university live over the weekend and
not meet any colleagues in, interpret.
[LAUGH] And I think these are like two,
three recent examples.
I, I could continue,
I guess for the next hours, but
I guess, you know,
the course time is also limited.
>> And, and you know, they a social hiking
app is one that I really like as well.
I think many of us can relate to
the feeling of being over-connected, and,
and has done some wonderful work on
using technology to actually
reverse that effect.
So I'm looking forward to seeing
what happens with that project next.
Thanks so much for joining us Yohannes.
And I encourage everyone to go ahead and
check out Yohannes papers, they're
really wonderful and, and very creative.
>> Thank you, Brand.
