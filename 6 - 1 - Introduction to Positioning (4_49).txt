Hi, folks.
Welcome back to the [SOUND] University
of Minnesota's spacial computing MOOC.
This week, we're going to be focusing
on the subject of [SOUND] positioning.
Now, our learning objectives for
this module are pretty straightforward.
First by the end of this module,
you should have a general idea of how on
earth your smartphone knows where you are.
And to foreshadow a bit here,
your smartphone does something far
more complicated than just using GPS.
Because of this,
by the end of this module,
you should also no longer be participating
in one of my biggest spatial computing pet
peeves, which is the dramatic misuse
of the term GPS in the popular lexicon.
So, for instance, you'll say latitude and
longitude coordinate rather than GPS
point unless you really mean GPS point.
And to be honest,
GPS point isn't the best term overall.
Now, by the end of this module,
you'll also be familiar with
an important frontier in positioning,
a family of methods that I've
called content-based positioning.
Now, understanding content-based
positioning techniques has
important implications not only for
your understanding of how spatial
computing technologies work and how to
build spatial computing technologies, but
also for the concept of privacy
in our new big data world.
Okay, so let's go ahead and
dig into this module.
Now, at a high level, positioning is
about a very simple question, and
that very simple question is, where?
So, for instance,
where is my property line?
Where should a missile go?
Where is a certain member of an,
of an endangered species?
And one of the most important where
questions in spatial computing these
days is, where is this smartphone user?
Now the concept of the geo-atom,
which was introduced by Dr.
Michael Goodchild in 2007 and
perhaps 1999 as well.
It depends on how you define introduced.
But regardless, the geo-atom provides
us with a good framework for
understanding the importance and role
of positioning, and the importance and
role of the where questions.
Now, most types of geographing information
you'll encounter can be reduced to
the geo-atom, which explains its name.
Now, roughly speaking, we can think of
a geo-atom as describing a point and
attribute tuple or
a point and attribute pair.
Now, the Z in the geo-atom
refers to an attribute.
So, for instance, in the case of
John Snow's cholera investigation,
we might think of Z as the presence or
absence of a person sick with cholera.
Most things you see mapped
can be considered Zs.
So, for instance, temperature, population,
air quality, the content of a tweet,
the article text of a Wikipedia article,
and so on and so forth.
Now, z of x refers to the value
of the attribute at a location x.
So, for example, for the temperature case,
a z of x can be ten degree Celsius, or
here in Minnesota in the wintertime, for
instance, negative ten degrees Celsius,
right?
We can also think of a tweet, an Instagram
photo coming from a specific location.
These are all z of x's, same deal with
Wikipedia articles about x and so on,
and so forth.
And lastly, x is, once again, the location
at which the attribute was measured.
Positioning is all about the x.
In most of the previous modules,
we focused on all parts of
the geo-atom when talking
about geographing information.
In this module, we're going to dig much
deeper into the x and focus solely on it.
Now, more specifically,
we're going to dig into determining the x
of a user of a special computing system.
This is going to be the focus.
The importance of accurately and
consistently being able to determine an u,
a user's position or a user's x really
can't be understated in special computing.
Doing so underlies pretty much
all location-based services,
a large number of big data geography
analysis, and so on and so forth.
Okay, before we move
away from the geo-atom,
I do want to clarify one
common point of confusion.
The x here does not refer to
just the horizontal dimension or
just the latitude in a latitude and
longitude pair.
Note here that the x is bold and
this means that it refers
to a vector of values.
So, one possible vector consists
of both a latitude and longitude.
Another might also include a z coordinate,
and another might add in a time coordinate
for, for instance, a spaciotemporal
representation, and so on, and so forth.
Okay, moving on here, in this module,
we're going to consider two broad
families of positioning methods.
The first family, we're going,
we're going to call, for
a lack of a better term,
signal-based positioning methods.
Now, this family consists
of techniques like GPS, or
the Global Positioning System,
but also others as well.
The second family consists of
content-based positioning methods,
as I was discussing earlier.
Okay, that's it for
the introduction about positioning.
I'll see you in the next video, where,
where we'll, where we'll begin to discuss
signal-based positioning methods.
