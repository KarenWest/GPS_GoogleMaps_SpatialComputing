Hey folks, in this video, we're going to
be talking about an exciting research
project entitle,
Explanatory Semantic Relatedness and
Explicit Spacialization for
Exploratory Search.
This project is really great for
this course, because it's a wonderful
example of how the spatial domain and
the computive domain can work together for
their mutual advancement.
Now in particular, this project has a,
a made contributions to
the literature on spatialization
as we discussed in Module seven.
In fact, we introduced the idea of
explicit spatialization in this paper.
But then we also leveraged
this contribution to
early innovated information retrieval,
which is an area of computer science.
So, you can see the feedback loop here
going with computer science helping
cartography and
cartography helping computer science.
So as you might guess, this project is a,
a quite close,
interdisciplinary collaboration.
A bunch of us are trained
in computer science, but
three of us also have backgrounds in
geographic information science which is
obviously a field quite
close to spatial computing.
Okay, so let's step back here and,
and provide a little motivation.
I think we all know that using any one
of these fine search engines here it's
a relatively easy task to, for instance
find out who the mayor of Minneapolis is.
In fact using Google and Bing these days,
you'll get a direct answer.
I'm sure many of you are familiar
with this particular feature.
You can also find a web
page of basically anything.
So, for instance I, with just, with
just one query I found the web page for
this, a spatial computing MOOC
here you may be familiar with it.
But what happens if you are a student
who's been given the task of writing
a detailed report on nuclear weapons,
or perhaps more consequentially you're
a consultant or an intelligence analyst
who's been asked to do the same thing.
Well, in this case Google basically
is just going to point you
to the nuclear weapons
page on Wikipedia and
you're going to have to do
the rest of the work yourself.
So as it turns out this is actually
a very well known situation in
the information retrieval literature.
So Google and
Bing are known to be outstanding at what
are called closed information requests,
like for instance finding out
who the Mayor of Minneapolis is.
And they're also known to be
outstanding at navigational queries,
like take me to the web page on the spa,
for the spatial computing MOOC, but
they're much worse at what is
known as exploratory search.
And now exploratory search
has been defined by White and
Roth as defining an information seeking
problem context that is open ended,
persistent and multifaceted.
Exploratory search systems support
this through symbiotic human
machine relationships that
provide guidance in exploring
unfamiliar information landscapes.
Now you can imagine that
this last line here,
exploring unfamiliar
information landscapes.
This made those of us with a background
in geographic information science,
it made us quite excited.
Now the reason it made us quite
excited is that we recognize that
thematic cartography has been shown over,
over a very long time to be effective at
helping people understand complex and
unfamiliar information landscapes.
We saw a little bit about this in,
module seven, right?
So the big question for
us is how can we convert an abstract non
geographically referenced query concept,
like for instance, nuclear weapon,
into a form that like obesity rates by
state or poverty rates by state like we
saw earlier into a form that can be
visualized using thematic cartography?
Well, the first things a lot of people
suggest when when we pose this question is
to just use Google Maps.
But Google Maps like its parent search
engine, is largely designed for
navigational queries and
closed information requests, so for
instance here is the result of querying
Google Maps for nuclear weapons, or
at least this is the result
as of a little while ago.
As you can see this is basically
just a map of museums and advocacy
organizations that are related to nuclear
weapons, and that have a web presence.
Obviously for exploratory search here.
There's a little bit missing for
instance, there's nothing about current
events related to nuclear weapons, and
there's a little bit missing about
the history of nuclear weapons as well.
So this is where a system we
built called ATLASIFY comes in.
And I'm going to show you
what ATLASIFY can do and
then we'll talk about the really
cool ways it, it does it.
And you'll see that a lot of what
we've learned in Module seven and
Module six as well comes in here and,
and turns out to be pretty handy.
So without further ado, here is
the results of here's, here's ATLASIFY,
showing the results of a query for
nuclear weapon.
Now on this map like most choropleth maps,
right, or
like all choropleth maps done well here,
the dark green or
the dark color indicates areas that
are very related to nuclear weapons.
And the lighter green areas indicate
areas that are less related, right.
So in this case we have a quantitative
spatial attribute, relatedness and
we're visualizing it using the appropriate
quantitative choropleth map strategies.
Now you can see that in contrast to
the Google Maps result we saw earlier.
Current events are strongly incorporated,
as is the geographic
history of nuclear weapons.
You can, zoom in and zoom out like
any modern, geographic technology.
And we can see that,
as we might expect, Nevada and
New Mexico are both indicated to be
highly related to nuclear weapons.
so, it's great that you can see the
information landscape of places related to
your query concept, in this case nuclear
weapons, but, if you're anything like me,
a very quickly after you use this system,
you want to know how are these
places related, right?
So, for example if we move on
over here to Sub-Saharan Africa.
Let's say I'm curious about why South
Africa is so related to nuclear weapons.
Now in ATLASIFY you can click
on any geographic entity and
ATLASIFY is going to display a list of
relationships between the clicked entity.
And the query concept in understandable
natural language and this involved some
natural language processing which we'll
briefly touch on at the end of this video.
So here it's saying that South Africa
began a nuclear weapons program in
the late 70's, and moving down the list
here we find out that at later
destroyed it's arsenal, and joined the
Nuclear Non Per, Non-Proliferation Treaty.
So, hopefully what I've shown you so far,
gives you an idea of the power of this
particular, exploratory search approach.
But like, like when we were
discussing things in the,
fifth video of module seven, right?
When we were talking about specialization.
Well we've, what I've described to you so
far is, limited in very one,
in one very important way, and
that is that it only works in geography,
just like we were talking
about with spatialization.
So the problem here is that
exploratory search, of course,
goes well beyond geography, right,
people do exploratory searches about
chemistry about politics,
and so on and so forth.
And of course a cross domain
exploratory searches as well.
So in, in our Atlas flight
project in this research,
in this research paper ,we
developed techniques that
allowed us to use the exact same approach
as we used to create this u, related map,
relatedness map excuse me, and
used those approaches to create this map.
Now as you can see here,
this is the same query concept done,
nuclear weapon, but here it's visualized
on the periodic table reference
system rather than the world
map reference system right?
We learned a little bit
about this in module seven,
this is an explicitly
spatialized reference system.
In this case using the periodic table.
You can zoom in and zoom out,
note that uranium and
plutonium are indicated
to be highly related.
And just like with geography,
you can click on a special entity, and
get natural language explanations of
the relationships between the clicked
entity and the query concept.
So, in this case, the user clicked on,
it looks like Cobalt, and
the system is showing relationships
between nuclear weapon and Cobalt.
So we've gone, all out here with
the explicit spatialization and,
let's support a number of
different of reference systems, so
for example here is the US Senate
seating chart reference system.
We have the same, we have the same
clear concept nuclear weapon, but
it is visualized instead of on the world
map and instead of on the periodic table.
It is the US Senate seating chart.
It's a little bit of an old seating chart.
There are some Senators who have moved
on and some Senators who are new.
I bet you get the basic idea.
Here is the same query concept nuclear
weapon on the time-line reference system
and so on and so forth.
These are just four of the 13 reference
systems Atlas5 is currently supporting in,
in various states of completion.
A note that, we're hoping to launch
Atlas5 to the public, early in 2015,
so keep yours eyes peeled
to Atlas5.com for that.
I'm going to shift away from
the system now, and talk about the how.
So we've seen, right, that we can convert
a query concept, like nuclear weapon,
into something that can be visualized
using thematic cartography, and
we've seen that we can do this and
reference systems from arbitrary domains.
How are we able to do this?
Well, you've already learned a little bit
about how we did this in module six, and
that is that we use semantic
relatedness estimates, and
in this case, we built a state of
the art semantic relatedness measure.
And the output of this measure is our
quantitative spacial attribute that
we're visualizing using
thematic cartography.
So for example, these states here had
a much higher relatedness value to
nuclear weapons than for
instance Alabama over here.
Okay, so hopefully this description of
our Atlas flight project really gives you
an idea of some exciting new stuff
going on in special computing.
And also just to reinforce this point
really demonstrates how the spatial and
the computing work
together to benefit both.
So we have a symmetrical line measures
from natural language processing,
powering new techniques in spatialization.
Which then power new techniques
in exploratory search.
Which again a computing area.
So a very rich uh,feedback loop there.
And with that,
I will see you in the next video.
