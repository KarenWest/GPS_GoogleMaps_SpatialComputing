Welcome to the Spatial Computing Massive
Open Online Course.
This module we will be studying spatial
query languages.
And in the first short video, the goal
would be simply
to understand the notion of query and the
notion of query languages.
So, after this short video you should be
able to describe the
purpose of a query and the purpose of a
query language, okay?
So lets start with the notion of queries,
okay?
So a dictionary meaning of query is a
question.
So the idea is to pose a question to an
audience which may be a human or a
computer system.
And in our course, a database which has
geographic information.
So how do we pose such querys nowadays?
The simplest one is to use a pointing
device, like a mouse.
So, if you were using a mapping system,
such
as geographic information system, or even
Google Earth, if you
simply mouse over a place in the map,
usually
the system will pop up the name of that
place.
Okay.
So essentially with the mouse action, one
can attach a default
query, such as give me the place name or
some other property.
Okay.
Another common query many of us have
experienced is via search engines.
If you're working with Google search or
Bing
search we can type in a couple of keywords
and the search engine provides us a list
of
documents or URLs which has information
about the keywords.
So for example if you wanted to learn more
about spacial computing or SQL,
you could type in those keywords and get
documents which give you more detail.
Now in databases, in this course, our
queries will look little more
structured, such as what is written on the
bottom of the slide.
You, here you're seeing a Select statement
from SQL query language.
And this is a way to essentially ask for
all senators who are female.
So assuming we had a table listing all the
senators then
you could essentially find the set of
senators which are female.
Now once we understand the notion of
query, we can talk about query language.
So broadly, a query language is a language
through which we pose questions.
And again we have experienced this in real
world in many different ways.
The broadest language through which we
pose question is
a natural language,such as English or
French or Spanish.
But this is very effective when we are
posing questions to other human
beings, such as instructors in this course
or another student or your friend, okay?
Computer systems have often tried to
understand questions posed in natural
language.
Apple Siri is an example of that.
But at present their capabilities are
limited, they can usually
only answer very simple questions in
English, not general questions.
So in general when we work with computers,
we still primarily use computer languages.
An example of that may be Java.
So if you know how to do programming in
Java,
you can actually write programs to answer
many, many different questions.
However, for most of us the Java
programming is very, very verbose
and tedious and it takes a long time to
pose such queries.
So if you think about the database word
back
in 1950s, that's how queries were posed to
databases.
People would write [UNKNOWN] programs just
to create a simple
report but nowadays you know, we can do
something simpler.
So structured query language arose in
1980s
and very soon it became the Lingua Franca.
You know, some people call it universal
data speak.
And most relational databases understand
SQL queries, such
as the one we saw in the last slide.
In mapping systems or geographic
information systems,
sometimes SQL is supplemented by the
interaction devices.
So with mouse clicks or mouse over simple
default queries can also be attached.
So in this particular course we'll focus a
lot on SQL.
In the following video segments we'll go
and look at the details of SQLs
by looking at different statements and
different
kind of questions that can be posed.
So with this, we'll wrap up this
particular video segment.
In the following ones we'll come and see
more details
of SQL, including details relevant to
posing questions of geographic data.
