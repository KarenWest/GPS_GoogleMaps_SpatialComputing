Welcome back to the VGI module.
In this video, we're going to cover,
we're going to cover two of our learning
objectives understanding
the sociotechnical systems behind BGI, and
being able to evaluate the pros and
cons of using, using VGI for
a given problem context.
What we're going to do through the video,
is walk through a series of pros and
cons, and I'll explain the sociotechnical
mechanisms behind many of the pros and
the cons.
But first,
what on Earth am I talking about,
when I use this term, sociotechnical?
Unfortunately, this isn't going to be
a lecture about the borg or a terminator,
although I'm happy to discuss these topics
with you all in the discussion forum,
I'm a fan of both of these movies.
Instead, within computer science,
the term,
socio-technical, is often used
to refer to computing systems,
in which there are two mutually dependent,
and equally important components.
The first component is people
interacting with each other,
and the second component is technology
mediating, or supporting that interaction.
Many of the hottest websites and
apps these days, like Facebook and
Twitter are indeed sociotechnical systems.
So, for instance, Facebook has hundreds of
really smart computer scientists, working
on cool algorithms that serve us the most
interesting content in our news feeds, and
help us easily search
our friend's content.
But without people signing up and actually
interacting wi, with each other on
Facebook, Facebook would be basically
worthless, it is a socio-technical system.
Most platforms on which people
create VGI are indeed like Facebook,
like Twitter socio-technical systems.
This is the case for VGI produ,
peer production, VGI excuse me
like Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap, and for
social media VGI like Twitter and Flickr.
And speaking of which, let's talk
about the first major pro of VGI, and
that is that VGI occurs at a truly massive
scale, Many VGI datasets can really,
justifiably be called, big data.
So for instance,
as of earlier this year OpenStreetMap
had over 3.8 billion GPS points.
Foursquare had over 5 billion check ins.
Twitter has over a million
geo-tagged tweets a day, and
flickr just released a data set of
49 million geo-tagged flickr photos.
Now comparing VGI to traditional data
sources is easiest with Wikipedia.
Now if printed, the English Wikipedia
would fill about 2000 volumes of
Encyclopedia Britannica, which in it's
final printed version had only 32 volumes.
And, since about 20% of the English
Wikipedia is explicitly geotagged,
20% of English Wikipedia articles, have
these latitude and longitude coordinates.
This means that the English Wikipedia
has far more geotagged content,
than the Encyclopedia Britannica
has content overall.
Now clearly one major
benefit of the VGIs scale.
In examining this benefit from
a socio-technical perspective,
two themes emerge One is technical and
one is social.
Now from a technical perspective, the
massive scale of VGI is enabled first and
foremost by the democratization of
the means of geographic information
production and dissemination.
And this roughly corresponds to
the enabling technologies we discussed in
the first video in the module.
Primarily, the fact,
the fact that many people now have
advanced GPS devices in their pockets, and
can easily publish Geotag information,
that can be read by the entire world.
Now the same time,
there is indeed a strong social component.
Namely, people actually have to
use a specific VGI platform, for
there to be a lot of
VGI from that platform.
And there are many examples of VGI
platforms that this didn't occur for
right that these VGI
platforms never took off.
So for example, there's this
Wikipedia-like site, or a Wiki.
Which is dedicated exclusively
to New York Topics, and
has only received three edits in the past
30 days, and has only 175 pages overall.
Now in fact, although there
are important exceptions like for
instance the Star Wars Wiki,
called Wookiepedia, which is a great name.
Most wikis on the popular wiki hosting
platform wikia are largely failures.
This is true even though they
are based on the roughly the same wiki
software as Wikipedia.
So in other words,
they have nearly identical technology,
but they have a hugely different outcome.
This is the power of social,
in the success of a VGI system.
Now the grow, growing graveyard here
of failed and mostly failed social
network companies, provide analogies
on the social media VGI side of things.
Many of these sites would be
providers of large datasets and
view tag content,
if they still were prominent today.
Now similar to the situation
with the New York Wiki and
Wikipedia, these websites had many of
the same technological features as
successful competitors like Facebook.
But people just stopped
interacting on these platforms.
While the technological differences
probably played at least some
small role in these sites' decline, there
was certainly a social factor as well.
Now understanding the success and
the failure of online
communities including those that produce
social media and peer production BGI.
This is a major topic of study in
the social computing research community,
which is my other main research
area besides Spatial Computing.
You know, great research on resource,
excuse me, on online communities written
for our general audience,
is building successful online communities,
a book project led by two social commuting
all-stars, Dr. Bob Kraut and Dr.
Paul Resnick.
Now in this book Dr.
Resnick and Kraut, and
their colleagues, write that the famous
line from the movie Field of Dreams,
if you build it they will come, does not
at all apply for online communities.
Instead they write that a new online
community, say for instance a social
network that supports geo-tagging, needs
to overcome three important challenges.
The first of these challenges is
carving out a useful niche, or
making sure that what your community
is going to do, is unique and valuable.
So for instance back in the year 2000,
there was no free online encyclopedia so
Wikipedia was created,
it had a unique and valuable niche.
The second challenge is in the words
of Doctor Kraut and Doctor Resnick.
Defending your niche in the ecology
of competing communities, and
alternative ways that potential
members can spend their time.
And finally, the last challenge, and
this is a really big one, is making sure
you can get a critical mass of users.
Any community that fails to address these
challenges, will likely not succeed and
there are many examples of this occurring,
for
instance, the New York wiki on Wikia,
Friendster, and Myspace.
So what are the implications
of this research,
into the social side of online
communities for VGA data sets.
Well, it means that there are a number
of very large scale VGA data sets,
these were the successful communities.
And there are lots and lots and
lots of very, very small VGA data sets,
these are the failed communities.
And as a consumer of VGI this probably
won't be a big problem for you.
You can simply take advantage of
the really unprecedented amount of
geographically referenced content,
from prolific VGI data sources,
like Wikipedia and Twitter.
However if you work in spatial computing
long enough you might find that you
want to gather a large amount
of data about some topic you
can't study with existing VGI data sets.
What the research of Dr.
Kraut and Dr. Resnick and
their many colleagues tells us, is that
trying to develop your own special VGI
community to gather this data, must be
done with great care and preparation.
And unfortunately, is unlikely to
succeed without extensive effort,
in the alignment of forces that
may be out of your control.
So basically you'll need
a little bit of good luck.
So, to learn how to increase
your chances of success,
there are a number of strategies one
can employ but those are best left for
a social computing course rather
than a spatial computing course.
For those of you who are interested,
you can check out Dr. Resnick and Dr.
Kraut's book.
So let's add a quick qualifier here to our
large scale pro, and that is that it's
only large when the community succeeds and
this is only occurs in special cases.
These special cases are very important,
like Twitter and
Wikipedia but there are actually,
if you look at the whole ecology of VGI
communities they're actually quite rare.
Okay, let's move on to our second
pro here and that is accessibility.
VGI tends to be quite
accessible to researchers and
developers, and
this is a pretty awesome advantage of VGI.
So for instance both major sources of
peer production VGI, Open Street Map and
Wikipedia, allow anyone to download
full database dumps of their data, and
both data sets have licenses that
permit a wide range of uses.
Premade Open Street Map extracts for the
entire world, or just parts of the world
can be downloaded from Open Street Map's
website, or a number of third party
partner sites For instance Gail Fabric.de,
that's generally the most popular one.
Now it's even easier to obtain and
use Wikipedia data.
My my lab working with Dr.
who's a professor at Macalester College,
we recently released out
Wiki Brain software.
We're pretty excited about Wiki Brain
with Wiki Brain anyone with Java
programming skills can easily download and
leverage the information in Wikipedia,
including its geo tags you can imagine
that I made sure that was included.
We've also included implementations of
some of the most well known artificial
intelligence Wikipedia based
algorithms that have been published in
the last few years.
Those of you in the technical track
will actually get a chance to use Wiki,
WikiBrain for yourself in,
in an assignment at the end of the module.
Now WikiBrain is far from the only
way to get and use Wikipedia data.
There are Wikipedia libraries in
other programming languages as well.
And you can download, for
instance, here Wikipedia data
straight from Wikipedia's website.
Wikipedia also has an API,
which we'll talk,
which we'll be talking
about just in a bit here.
So social media VGI tends to also be
very accessible, although less so
than Wikipedia and Open Street Map.
So nearly all online communities in
which people produce social media BGI,
provide researchers and
developers access to the community's VGI
through something called an application
programming interface or
if you talk to programmers
they'll call it an API.
Now broadly speaking, in this context APIs
allow any programmer to build a system,
that can interact with another system,
in this case, for
instance a website that has VGI data.
So for example, as I noted earlier,
I used the Twitter API to download
tweets that mention the term gopher, so
that I could make the map I
showed you in the last video.
Now unfortunately website APIs tend to
come with a very robust set of rules and
limitations, and
social media VGI APIs are no exception.
So for instance, the Twitter API one
can use to download public tweets,
as they're posted is called
the Twitter Streaming API.
The streaming API only provides
a very small sample of all tweets.
So to get all tweets, you really have
to shell out big bucks to Twitter, or
a third party data provider.
However, actually, for those of us in VGI,
there's some really good news to report.
Recent research by Morstatter and
colleagues,
found out something pretty cool about API
access to geo tag Tweets, specifically.
It appears that at least as of a year or
two ago, the Twitter Streaming API
includes 90% of all geotag Tweets.
So while the Streaming API will only
provide you with a tiny percentage of
overall Tweets for a known,
unknown reason when it
comes to VGI the Twitter API includes
nearly everything posted by Twitter users.
So this is very good news for
those of us in spatial computing.
Now another lim, another really common
limitation of APIs in the VGI space is
that the data you receive using the API,
is not yours to do what you
want with there are some very common and
very strict limitations on usage.
So for instance, I actually can't
post the data about gophers that I
downloaded on the Internet for
you all to access and use for
instance in an assignment, because I'll
be in big trouble with Twitter if I do.
Now finally, APIs also tend to come
with something known as rate limits.
So for instance Instagram in many cases
will only allow programmers to ask for
information about 5,000 photos per hour.
Now while it seems like a lot, why would
you ever need 5,000 photos per hour.
This actually runs out pretty quickly,
if you want to build an application about
a popular area, or
analyze a whole bunch of instagram photos.
All of these restrictions rate limits,
small samples of data,
usage limitations, these are all
put in for a number of reasons.
Profit for the social media VGI company,
privacy, making sure people don't overload
the social media VGI company servers.
But the important thing to remember,
is that even though you can get lots and
lots of VGI data through APIs
access to that data is going to
be restricted in some way.
So if you have a project that violates
some of those restrictions you need to
be aware of that.
Okay let's move on to the final
VGI advantage I'm going to
be talking about today.
And this is the fact that VGI
is an unprecedented source of
platial information.
Now to understand this advantage,
it's important to first understand
the concepts of Space and
Place and their relationship.
Now to people who are not
in spatial computing and
related fields like geography,
these terms mean roughly the same thing.
But to those of us in these fields,
they describe two fundamentally
different concepts.
These two concepts are important
ideas that can help us organize and
interpret, qualitative and
quantitative geographic information.
Space and place have been researched and
discussed and discussed over again, and
over and over again and analyzed and
so on and so forth for decades.
And it's really quite difficult
to summarize these concepts in
just a few short moments.
But for the purposes of just
giving you an over an overview so
you can understand this advantage of VGI,
I'm going to give it a shot here.
So, space can very roughly be defined
as referring to the positions of
entities on the surface of the earth,
and the relationships between them.
With space,
we're talking about latitude and
longitude points, well defined polygons
and polylines, raster cells and so on.
We're also talking about the time and
cost required to move between locations,
and so on and so forth.
Now, one good way to think about space,
is to think about the types of data and
operations supported by traditional
geographic information systems.
So here we're talking
about spatial queries,
network analyses, formal representations
of geometries and so on and
so forth, these are all spatial in nature.
So in other words, in all of Dr. Shankar's
lectures, you were basically dealing with
geographic information,
largely from a spatial perspective.
Now place on the other hand is,
in the words of
the highly influential place scholar,
Yi-Fu Tuan, humanized space.
Now very roughly speaking you can
think of a place as a personal and
emotional connections to a given space.
So more formally, the widely used Human
Geography text book series by Fellman,
Gettis, Gettis and colleagues describes
place as referring to the attributes and
values we individually
associate with a location.
Although our sense of place is individual,
there can be broad similarities with
many other people, something that
should be clear and a little bit here.
Now space and
place are complex concepts and can really
seem somewhat amorphous especially to
those of us with a technical background.
So I thought a concrete
example here might help.
And for this example let's turn our
attention to Century Link Field in
Seattle, where the Seattle Seahawks
play their games.
The Seattle Seahawks are an American
football team, that is the hated rival of
the finest American football
team in the entire world,
the team with the best looking and the
smartest fans, the San Francisco 49ers.
Now the 49ers just happened
to be my home team, and
the team I have grown up cheering for
now I guess for the past 31 years.
So in summary, all you need to know
about American Football, for those of
you outside the United States, is that the
49ers are the team you should root for.
And the Seahawks are the team
that you should root against.
So, by continuing on with our space and
place example, the 49ers and the Seahawks
played each other at CenturyLink
field in the semi-finals last year.
And unfortunately the Seahawks managed
to achieve a last minute victory.
Now fortunately while this was a terrible
day in the lives of the entire family,
this event was a wonderful teaching moment
for the concepts of space and place.
Now in this case the space
under consideration is
the well-defined polygonal
outline of CenturyLink Field.
This polygonal outline can be
described as a series of latitude and
longitude coordinates, and this outline
can be stored in a spacial database and
can be considered in, for
instance, a spatial query.
There is also a polygon that,
in an absolute sense, is understood and
operationalized by both fans of
the 49ers and fans of the Seahawks.
However, thanks to the heartbreaking 49ers
loss that occurred in CenturyLink Field,
the sense of place of the field
differs extensively a,
across these two fan groups.
So for 49ers fans like myself, Century
Link Field evokes anger, frustration and
sad memories.
Now on the other hand for Sea Hawks fans,
CenturyLink Field evokes happiness,
confidence and well, excitement.
So for spatial information,
it's easy to see in this example how
traditional geographic
information is really sufficient.
As we saw in the previous video, official
agencies like local governments as well
as private companies, can provide us
with the outlines of polygons like
CenturyLink Field, as well, as well
as those of cities, states and so on.
It's important to note that VGI from
open street map is also good for
this purpose, at is as open street
maps meant to replicate and
extend this official information.
However, traditional geographic
information in open street map VGI,
is quite limited when it comes to
rich information describing place.
You can't download a record of
the emotions that a large number of
people associate with different locations
from government agencies, for instance.
Right?
Where you can find this type of
of data is in social media VGI.
The best example here comes from Twitter.
Using Twitter's public API, it would've
been relatively straightforward for
any researcher or developer, that includes
those of you in the technical track,
to download a large number of Tweets
coming from CenturyLink Field, or
about the semi-finals game in general.
And then you could examine them for
their emotional content.
So in fact, using a series of algorithms
called Sentiment Analysis Algorithms, it's
actually possible to do this type of study
or type of work in an automated fashion.
For instance Quercia and colleagues used
Geotag tweets and Sentiment Analysis,
to identify the happiest and
saddest communities in the London area.
So for example here,
you can see the town of
Brent it's named after me just
kidding I'm named after the town.
You can see in Brent here,
there's a sad are it's light blue and
a happier area, light red.
And too there are some happier
areas down in the suburbs here and
up here and
then some sadder areas over here as well.
It's easy to imagine
doing something similar,
with any number of social
media VGI resources.
So for instance, by mining the caption
of this geotagged Instagram photo.
It's easy to assess the authors that's me,
my positive emotional connection
to the University of Minnesota.
Okay, so just to summarize here, while
traditional geographic information and
open street map VGI are great for
spatial information.
Social media VGI presents
new possibilities,
when it comes to place based or
platial information.
Never before has platial information
been available at such a large scale.
So we, before we move on to the cons
of VGI let's make sure we're all on
the same page with a quick in video quiz.
So, I'm sure you all aced that quiz,
so we're ready to move onto the cons
of volunteered geographic information.
Now, just like there were three pros,
I'm going to present three cons, and they
might be a bit of a downer in that they
provide constraints on the utility of VGI.
But it's really critical that you
understand these downsides of VGI,
well before you use VGI in a study or
a system.
I think you'll agree with that
statement by the time we go through all
three of these.
The good news here is that
the disadvantages in my view
are more interesting significantly so
actually, than the advantages.
Now, the first disadvantage of VGI we're
going to talk about is coverage bias, and
this is a really fascinating one.
To understand coverage bias in VGI,
it's important to note two things.
first, VGI strongly reflects the cultural
context of its contributors.
Second, certain cultural groups
produce far more VGI than others.
Now, if we put these together,
it's easy to see that VGI tends to
be focused more on certain cultural
groups, than on other cultural groups.
A straightforward and a very fun set
of examples comes from Wikipedia.
So at this point in the module,
all of you should be familiar with
the English Wikipedia,
even if you've been lying under a rock for
the past 10 years and just decided
to come out just to take this MOOC.
However, many folks are much less
familiar with the dozens, and
dozens, and dozens of other language
editions in which Wikipedia exists.
I just checked the other day, and
there were 287 in total,
286 that had at least one article.
Now, a couple of years ago,
my colleagues and
I did the first large scale comparisons,
of
how encyclopedic knowledge is represented
across many of these language editions.
We found that each language edition
describes the world very differently.
So, for example let's look at
the concepts that have an article in
each language edition that we looked at.
So for instance, the concept of chocolate,
as you might imagine,
had an article in all 25 language editions
that we examined in this particular study.
So for instance,
here is the English article, chocolate.
Here is the Spanish article, [FOREIGN].
Here is the Chinese article I'm
told this is pronounced [FOREIGN].
Here is the Russian article I'm not
going to try to pronounce that one.
Here is the German article,
[FOREIGN] and so on and so forth.
However, we actually found that the
commonest of chocolate across all of these
language editions, was actually very rare,
in fact, most concepts looked like this.
It's a concept that we, or
a type of concept, excuse me,
that we call single language concepts.
And this chart here on the x axis,
you can see the number of languages
in which a concept appeared.
And on the Y axis, you can see
the number of concepts that appeared in
that number of languages, and it's pretty
easy to see that the vast majority of
concepts appear in only a single language.
So in other words, it's a concept that,
that's only described in by an article in
one language edition or one of the 25
language editions, that we looked at.
And if we look all the way over here
here we're talking about concepts that
appear in all 25 language
editions that we looked at.
We're talking about a very small
percentage of concepts, so only 0.17%.
Chocolate happens to be one of these,
but there aren't very many others.
Every language edition that we looked at
had a ton of single language concepts.
So for
instance here in the English Wikipedia.
The article on Hillbilly Jedi describes
a concept that is only described in
the English Wikipedia.
You can't find an article on
Hillbilly Jedi, anywhere else.
Hillbilly Jedi is the latest
album by the country music duo,
the American country music duo,
Big & Rich.
Has a wonderful item,
album title but despite that,
there are not articles on Hillbilly Jedi
in any other language edition.
Moving over to the Spanish Wikipedia,
we can see that
the Festival Internacional Chihuahua.
This is roughly speaking, for
those of you in the United States,
the state fair of the state of Chihuahua,
Mexico.
The Festival Internacional in
Chihuahua had only an article in
the Spanish Wikipedia.
Here is Dieter Mietz, he's a soccer
player from the 1970s from Germany.
He only had an article
on the German Wikipedia.
Here's Dieter Groß,
a german politician, he also only had
an article in the German Wikipedia.
Here's Dieter Klumpp, Dieter Klumpp
is a German business executive.
Also only has an article in the German
Wikipedia, and in fact, we looked into it,
and there were 762 more Dieters that only
had articles in the German Wikipedia.
Up until now,
we've looked at entire language editions.
What about the VGI, or
the geotag Wikipedia articles
in each language edition?
Well these articles are no exception.
They're biased towards the interests
of the cultural communities,
that created them just like
the larger language editions are.
So for example, my colleagues and
I developed a metric called indegree
sums that examines the lengths between
articles in a given language edition, and
determines how important
a certain region of the world is,
as determined by that language edition.
So, if you'll follow me over
here you can see that here we
have a map of indegree sums in Europe,
according to the Polish Wikipedia.
And it's pretty easy to see that
Poland has by far the highest,
indegree sum in all of Europe.
And in fact, if we zoom out,
we can see that Poland has by far
the highest indegree sum in the entire
world, according to the Polish Wikipedia.
Now as I said earlier, we can think of
indegree sums as a metric of importance,
so according to this map, we can say that
Poland has by is Poland excuse me is
by far the most important country in the
world according to the Polish Wikipedia.
It's Indegree Sum is actually 3.4 times
higher, than the country with the next
highest Indegree sum which in
this case is the United States.
Now it wasn't just the Polish Wikipedia,
we saw this with,
it was with all of them that we
looked at for the most part.
So here's the same map according
to the Russian Wikipedia.
You can see that according
to the Russian Wikipedia.
Russia is by far the most
important country in the world.
Here is the same map according
to the English Wikipedia,
we can see that England and
the United States very much stand out.
And then here is the same map
according to the Japenese Wikipedia.
Janepese Wikipedia was
something of an outlier.
According to Japenese Wikipedia,
Japan is as defined as an indegree sums,
seven times more important than any
other country in the entire world.
Now if we size each country,
by the, its importance according to
the Japanese Wikipedia, we can see that
the world would look something like this.
Now this is something that's
called a cartogram, and
we'll cover cartograms just briefly
in the cartography lecture.
We can also look at indegree sums, at the
first order administrative district level,
so here I'm talking about states and
provinces, and so on and so forth.
Now, here's indegree sums in
the English Wikipedia in North America.
And you can see that,
at least north of the Mexican border,
indegree sums roughly follow
the distribution and population, so
California is a very popular state
it has the highest indegree sum,
Texas is also very populous and New York,
Pennsylvania and so on and so forth.
Now I want to call your attention over
here to French Canada,is specifically
Quebec, as I show you Indegree
sums not according to
the English Wikipedia ,but
according to the French Wikipedia.
So we have English Wikipedia,
and French Wikipedia.
In addition, it's not just language groups
where we see these types of biases.
Although it's less familiar, we can also
talk about cultural groups in terms of
profession, age, religion,
gender, and many other factor.
Recent research out of group lens,
my lab here at the University
of Minnesota, has shown that we
see the same issues across gender lines in
Wikipedia as we did across language lines.
Now some of you may be aware that
Wikipedia has a disproportionately male
editor population.
A 2009 survey for instance found that
87% of Wikipedia's, editors were male.
Now investigating this further,
my colleagues and
students in our lab used movie,
movie rating data from our lab's MovieLens
website, you can see MovieLens right here.
And we use this data to show
that due to the fact that there
are fewer female editors in Wikipedia,
articles about movies like
the Notebook which are more highly
rated by female movie lens users,
tend to be shorter on average than
articles about movies like Rambo,
which tend to be more highly
rated by male movie lens users.
So it's pretty clear that Wikipedia tends
to be biased towards the interests of
it's population of editors,
whether we look at that population from
the perspective of language, gender or
likely other factors as well.
Now before we move on,
I want to highlight that I've referred to
these biases as coverage biases,
rather than more explicit biases.
It's important to point out that
the issue of bias in Wikipedia,
is not one in which for instance people
of one political viewpoint, like for
instance what I'm showing here
Insult opposing politicians.
Now this is considered vandalism in
Wikipedia and is, is quickly corrected.
Something that we'll talk
about a little more in a bit.
Instead, bias in Wikipedia,
including in its VGI, exists in
a more implicit fashion in which certain
topics get covered more than other topics.
And, the topics that do get covered,
tend to be those that are of particular
interest to Wikipedia's editor community.
So, we're talking specifically
about coverage biases here.
Coverage biases are an equally
important issue in social media VGI.
People of certain cultural groups,
political viewpoints, genders,
professions, et cetera, tend to contribute
more social media VGI than others.
And what they contribute tends to
reflect their backgrounds, even more so
than in the case of pure production VGI.
As such, when we download social media,
media VGI, for
instance, using the Twitter API, and then
we use this VGI in our systems and in our
research studies, we're always including
more of some view points than of others.
So for instance my colleagues and
I have found that across several
types of social media VGI.
The perspectives of people
living in urban areas,
are disproportionately represented at
the expense of the perspectives of people
living in rural areas at least within
the United States where we did this study.
So for instance, if you'll look over here,
you'll see that we found that there are
3.5 times more Twitter users per capita,
in urban areas than in rural areas.
And these urban users produced 5.3 times
more tweets per capita, than rural users.
No more surprisingly you can
see here that the urban bias in
Four Square is particularly strong.
There are over 24 times more Four Square
users per capita in urban areas than in
rural ones.
And the ratio is about the same for
check ins per capita.
It's important to point out however,
that when it comes to social media VGI,
we shouldn't just rely on stereotypes
in terms of which viewpoints will be
over-represented and which viewpoints
will be under-represented.
So let's take Pinterest, for example.
Pinterest recently introduced its place
pins feature, which means that Pinterest,
like many of its brethren is now
in the social media VGI business.
So you can see here that I've made
a Pinterest board of some of my
favorite places, on or near the University
of Minnesota's Eastbank Campus.
If you come here to study eventually,
you'll probably frequent
some of these spots.
Now as it turns out, not many people
like me are active on Pinterest and
specifically Pinterest unlike Wikipedia,
is predominantly dominated
by female perspectives.
And as a result recent research has shown
that about 80% of Pinterest user base is
female, and the percentage of
active pinners is likely higher.
So as we might expect a topics that men
pin more than women tend
to be underrepresented.
Along the same lines, research taking
a number of different approaches, has
shown an African American perspectives,
are likely over represented on Twitter.
So for instance, the Pew Internet and
American Life Project,
found that while 16% of Americans
who identify as white use Twitter,
22% of Americans who identify
as African American do so.
Now as a quick side note,
the Pew Internet and
American Life Project is
a wonderful resource for
understanding the role the internet
plays in the lives of folks who live in
the United States, I highly recommend
that you check their website out.
Okay?
So
we've see that there are large coverage
biases in both peer production and
social media VGI.
What does this mean for those of us who
want to engage in VGI based projects?
Well, and this in, it,
this is quite important,
it means we have to be very careful.
In particular, we can't assume
that VGI presents an objective or
complete description of areas of interest.
Instead, we must acknowledge and
account for the fact that VGI will
present a view of the world that is
biased towards the perspectives,
of the people who contribute it.
And these people are likely far
from a representative sample,
of the stakeholders of
an area of interest.
Moving on here,
our second VGI disadvantage, is one
that is quite related to the first one.
And that is that not all
voices are equal in VGI, or
in other words people contribute to
VGI at very, very different rates.
Now this disadvantage is directly
connected to a very common
social technical phenomenon that
exists in online communities,
specifically long tail
contribution patterns.
In a long tail contribution pattern,
a small percentage of
users contribute a ton and mos,
most users contribute much less.
Right, so on, in this graph here we have
got the of contributions on the X axis,
and the number of contributors
on the Y axis, and
this graph is roughly representative
of man contribution patterns you'll
see from online communities.
So over here we have a small number
of users, right, who, who submit and
contribute a lot of information, and
a much larger number of users who
contribute much less information.
Now these users over here, the users
that contribute a ton of information,
these are often called power editors or
power users.
For example, researchers here at
the University of Minnesota,uh,
led by a former grad student here
at the U, named Reid Priedhorsky.
Reid and his colleagues found that
huge percentage of the content that
is viewed on the English Wikipedia,
is contributed by power enders.
So here's a graph from that,
that paper that came out in 2007.
This line here shows
that at least as of 2006,
the 10% of English Wikipedia editors,
with the most edits
contributed around 86% of the words people
actually viewed on the English Wikipedia.
This bottom line is even more incredible,
it tells us that the top 0.1% of
editors alone just these editors,
contributed over 40% of the words that
people viewed in the English Wikipedia.
Now, Dr. Muki Haklay,
a prominent professor of Geography at
the University College London,
is one of my favorite researchers and
contributors on long tail
contribution patterns and VGI.
He has a wonderful presentation about
the dominance of power editors on
Open Street Map, and this is a, this is,
here is a slide from that presentation.
Now in the Y axis here,
you can see the percentage of
the contributions in the United Kingdom to
Open Street Map, and on the X axis you can
see a bunch of different user names right,
So down here you can see the user names.
Now, what this graph tells
us is that just these users,
explicitly listed here by name
are responsible for over 80%
of the contributions to Open Street Map
in the United Kingdom in the year 2008.
Now the last point I want to make about
the unequal contribution patterns in
VGI producing online communities,
is that at a high level,
this phenomenon might really sound quite
familiar to you from the we are the 99%
slogan of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Now that movement wanted to call
attention to the fact that,
at least in the United States,
the top 1% of income earners earners,
over 20% of the nation's total income.
In VGI producing online communities,
we see similar disparities except we're
not talking about income and
top income earners.
We're talking about VGI contrib, VGI
contributions and top VGI contributors.
Okay, so it's time to talk
about the elephant in the room,
the final con of VGI, we're going to
be talking about which is, accuracy.
Now this is a particularly
important issue,
when considering peer production VGI.
Now many of you have probably
been told by your teachers and
perhaps your parents, to be skeptical of
everything you read in Wiki, on Wikipedia.
Now I get the pleasure of telling you
that at least in this very specific case,
your parents and
teachers are largely wrong.
Now in 2005 Nature, one of the most pro,
prominent scientific
journals in the world.
Nature published a comparison
of the English Wikipedia and
the Encyclopedia Britannica,
which is one of your readings this week,
this paper from Nature.
Now in the study,
experts found four serious errors in both
Wikipedia and the Encyclopedia Britannica.
So, the same number of serious errors
in both of these two resources,
one that's peer produced and
the other that is produced by experts.
Encyclopedia Britannica did, however,
have moderately fewer factual errors,
omissions and misleading statements,
with Britannica having,
I believe, let's see, 123 factual errors,
and the English Wikipedia having 162.
You'll find out the details about this,
say, when you do the readings this week.
Wikipedia has been found to be even
more accurate in specific domains.
So for instance, Reavley and
colleagues found that, to quote them,
the quality of information on depression
and schizophrenia on Wikipedia,
is generally as good or better than, that
provided by centrally controlled websites,
the Encyclopaedia Britannica and
a psychiatry textbook.
Now Doclar, Dr. Hacklay here has found
something similar with OpenStreetMap.
Specifically he compared OpenStreetMap
data to that produced by
the United Kingdom, the government
of the United Kingdom, excuse me.
And he found that where
OpenStreetMap had coverage,
it was quite similar to
the government data.
Now this isn't to say that VGI
peer production communities don't
have egregious inaccuracies on occasion.
So, for instance, a few months ago I
saw this on the Wikipedia page for
the American football
team from Washington,
D.C. Their rivals are the Dallas Cowboys.
And it, and it appears that someone
who is a fan of the Cowboys,
decided to vandalize the Washing,
Washington, D.C.
teams page by writing that the Cowboys
were the best team in the division.
It also appears they failed to realize
that they were bragging about the Cowboys
status from 1933 to 1949,
rather than in the present day.
However, I checked a little while later,
and
found that this vandalism had been fixed.
Now this is a very typical story when it
comes to Wikipedia vandalism, it appears,
but it's fixed, quickly.
Okay, so in general while VGI might be
slightly less accurate than other sources
of information in some cases, in other
cases it's as accurate or more accurate.
So for most projects VGI will probably be
good enough from an accuracy standpoint.
So this do, this downside,
this disadvantage is,
is relatively light weight
compared to the other two.
Okay, so
that's it for the pros and the cons of
VGI, I'll see you in the next video.
