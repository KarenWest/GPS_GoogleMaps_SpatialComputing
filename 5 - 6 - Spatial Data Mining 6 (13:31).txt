Welcome back to the discussion of spatial
data mining in previous videos we talked
about the definition of spatial data
mining, what it is, what it is not?
We gave examples of common pattern
families we briefly visited the
spatial statistical foundations, and
talked
about notions like auto-correlation, and
heterogeneity.
And so since then we have been looking at
different Barton families in detail.
We looked at location prediction models,
and how
they are different from the classical
prediction models.
We also looked at the Hart Spar detection
techniques, and
how they are different from classical
clustering methods like Cayman's.
In this video segment, we are going to
visit the topic of anomalies.
Or outliers.
Okay?
So after this module, we are going to we
should all be able to know
about spatial outlier detection tests and
distinguish those
from you know, the classical outlier
detection test.
In addition, we should also notice that
conceptually
spatial outliers are very different, than
global outliers.
And be able to distinguish the two.
Okay.
So with this let's go back, and quickly
recall the example we had for spatial
outliers.
So we all remember this traffic data from
Twin Cities Highways where, you
know, the y-axis were sensors on one
particular freeway, I-35 W, 60 sensors.
And x-axis was time of the day.
And, in particular, we were curious about
the sensor number
nine, because it's readings were very
different from its neighbors.
Okay.
Even though the individual readings were
not anomalous, because
there is plenty of this teal color in the
picture.
But, the you know, the.
Interesting part was that we, these
readings were different from neighbors,
okay.
To give you a much more simple
example to contrast global outlier, and
spatial outlier
let's look at a much simpler space so here
is a one dimensional space just location.
And we are looking at a simple attribute,
you
know, this attribute maybe traffic flow
along the highway.
It may be, you know, some other attribute
like rainfall along a river's length and
so on.
Okay?
So in the beginning at location zero, and
so on, the values are low.
Then it rises, peaks, comes down.
Then there is a spike here.
Then it all comes down, and then it
flattens out.
So, in this picture, if we first want to
talk
about the global outliers, what the
traditional statistics talks about.
Then it will essentially look at the
values.
It will essentially watch the values on
the attribute value x-axis, y-axis.
Okay.
And then if you do that, then essentially
values which are really
high, like the maxima, which I circled
here already look like the minima.
They will look very different than the
population.
Because most of the values are in the
center.
There only a couple of values this high or
that low.
And those are called global outliers,
okay?
In contrast to that, the spacial outliers
are values like this,
this spike, where this value is very
different than the neighbor.
So if you look at the location of s,
and then the locations near by just before
or after.
The values are very different, okay?
So again, if you know calculus, you can
treat it as the derivative notion, or
discontinuity notion.
And those are more interesting in space.
And again you can ask, why are these
interesting?
Okay, so you can relate this back to first
log geography.
Which basically said.
That nearby things are very similar.
So whenever there is an exception to First
Law of
Geography, it is interesting and people
want to look at that.
For example, in case of this traffic, when
this pattern was shown to the Department
of
Transportation, they felt that the sensor
nine was
a bad sensor and they replaced it, okay?
All right and the same thing can happen in
other
domains as well, where discontinuities may
flag some strange behavior.
So let's try to go, and see how people
detect it statistically.
So so the simplest tests are based on
visualization.
So one test is called Variogram Cloud.
So in this case, you know, if you again
look at the same data set.
Then, you know, we can create a
visualization of
this in two-dimension, which is shown on
the right.
Here x-axis and y-axis, are going to plot
pairs of points.
So if there are n points, in your original
data set.
In variogram plot, there are n queues two
points, roughly quadratic, okay?
For each pair, so if you think about a
pair, you know, which takes s, and it's
neighbor p.
So, p comma s is a pair.
For that pair, we compute two things.
First, we compute the difference in their
attribute value.
Which is very high right?
This difference is high and that goes on
the y-axis, okay.
It's a high difference.
The second thing we compute is, the
difference in
their location in space and that is very
low.
So that goes on the X-axis.
So this x-axis is the distance between the
two points, y-axis is the difference
between their attributes.
Okay, and then we put all the plot point
pairs in this plot.
Now once we have that then we essentially
say that points
that are close to this x equal to y axis
here.
In other words, their attribute value
difference is proportional to their
geographic distance.
Those points are considered normal,
because, they
are complying with first law of geography,
okay.
However, points which are on this left
corner, where attribute value difference
is much higher.
You know it's very very higher, but
geography difference
is low, they are flagged as pairs which
are anomalous.
And those pairs have to then processed, to
find the real spatial discontinuity.
So in this particular diagram, if you did
that, then you know, remember the special
outlier s.
So, the pairs involving that show up here
in the diagram,
and notice they have both in the upper
left hand corner.
Okay?
So they are the closest to, are farthest
away from this x equal to y line.
So these have to be processed, and once
you look at
them you notice that spatial outlier s
shows up in multiple pairs.
So that would be taken out, by manual
processing or eyeballing.
As the most often in data set.
And then you have to remove that and
reprocess the data to see if
the other points like b and q continue to
be often in or not.
Okay, so this is one test.
It's primarily for human conjunction or
it's a visualization based test.
There is another test called Scatterplot.
In this case we look at the same data set,
but
you know, the plot that we are creating is
slightly different.
So here in x-axis we look at attribute
value.
Okay?
So in, in plot, you know, each point in
Scatterplot, correspondce to an individual
original point, so if original data has n
point, Scatterplot also has n point.
However, those plot are pointed
differently.
Okay, for a given point let's say s or
p, in the scatter plot x-axis attribute
value, okay.
And the y-axis is average value in the
neighborhood, so we are in some sense.
Comparing attribute value of each point
with attribute value in the neighborhood.
You're sort of trying to do a difference
or derivative.
So if you plotted it this way, then you
can imagine that wherever you have first
law of
geography where the point is similar to
it's neighbors,
then they would like near x equal to y
line.
Okay?
But if the points are very far from this
line, then they're violating the first law
of geography.
So, again in this case, s turns out to be
the farthest one from the line.
But, you know, because of s, it turns out
it's neighbors p and q also get flagged,
because p and q also are moved away from
the line due to s, okay?
So again in this process, you have
to first remove the highest offending
point s.
And re-compute the value for its neighbors
to see if s
were not in the data set, will the
neighbors still be offending.
Okay?
So you have to do again one step of at a
time.
Okay?
Now scatterplot has been you know, if we
find a little bit to something
called moran scatter plot, and where the x
and y axis are refined slightly.
Okay?
So let's quickly take a look at that.
So in Moran's scatter plot, the x and y
axis, instead of being
that tribute value or neighborhood average
at
tribute value directly, they are
normalized statistically.
Okay?
So they are the z scores.
If you remember from your statistics,
given a
random variable x, it's z score
essentially is x.
You know, you subtract the mean of x, and
you divide it by it's entire deviation of
x.
Okay?
And that normalizes the value between zero
and one.
So that's what is done to each axis.
So here x-axis instead of guarding
attribute value for the point.
We are plotting z-score of attribute value
for the point okay?
And same thing on the y-axis.
Instead of plotting neighborhood average.
We are doing z-score of neighborhood
average.
And again, you look at, you know, this x
equal to y line,
things which are further away are flagged
and in this case, again, s
will be flagged and this method again you
have to take out the
highest offending point, and re-adjust the
neighbor's value before you flag other
points.
Okay?
You can do the same thing more directly
and in this case we're
going to show you a Z-test where you
basically take the safety end points.
And in this case your x-axis can be left
as location.
So the same location that we had before in
x-axis, can be used here.
And y-axis is essentially the difference,
between the
neighborhood attribute value, and the
points own attribute value.
So, you look at the difference and then
you normalize it, and when you do that,
then
essentially this horizontal line zero, is
where everything is
expected to lie based on first law of
geography.
Things which are very far away from this
zero.
Are considered outliers.
So for example, s in this case is about
two, three standard deviations away, and
is the highest offending.
Once you take out s, and readjust the
neighborhood value,
then you can look at for the second one,
okay?
So there are many different tests, that
people have designed to look at spatial
outlier.
From computing perspective.
Here is an interesting observation.
You know, in, in these cases, as you will
essentially see two types of computation.
One is model building.
For example in case of z-test, we had to
go and find the
average for the attribute, average for the
neighborhood minus the location and so on.
And once you have done that, then people
do the testing.
Then you can go back and revisit each
point and compute the value and complete
the test.
So a major insight is the following that
your neighbour, you
know, the model building phase is based on
a database operation called self join.
So if you remember the spatial equating
chapter that we did
before, we talked about spatial drawing
and we also talked about spatial
self drawing, and it turns out that most
of these are
cloud detection tests in terms of
computation behave like spatial self
drawing.
So if you have access to a good
SQL or just product, which implements
spatial drawing well.
Then you can scale up special out-lie
detection test, to very large data sets.
Okay?
All right.
And essentially, one scan of spatial joint
can give you these results.
Okay.
Great.
So again, spatial out-lie detection, you
know there are many tests.
And they are supported through many
software.
And you can even code them very easily
yourself.
But what is happening next, okay.
So, one issue with this test, if you
remember that in every case, we said, you
detect
one outlier at a time, because a bad
apple gives, you know, highest score to
its neighbors.
So if your dataset has many, many spatial
outliers, then it takes many iterations to
remove them.
So one direction of research, is looking
at ways to
predict multiple spatial outliers
simultaneously,
and reduce computational cost, okay.
The other issue you might have also seen
that
all the tests were based on a single
attribute, okay.
But in many data sets you have many, many
attributes.
So people, again, are looking at ways to
define tests with many attributes, okay.
And in general you know we look at scaling
up to larger data.
People are also looking at, other creative
ways to define outliers.
So again you might remember from the first
video, there
was an example of you know, farm lands in
North Korea.
Where somewhere close to transportation
features like,
roads, rivers, and others were not closed.
The ones which are not close, we have
flagged
as outliers, because they have violated
this common co-locations.
So farmlands being accessible by
transportation.
And again, if you're coming from an
agricultural domain that will make a
lot of sense, because you have to move the
product out and so on.
And things which are not closer
transportation, may have other nefarious
interpretations, okay.
And those are more creative definitions of
outliers, and
people are looking at many of those as
well okay.
So to wrap up this video segment, you
know, we
essentially wanted to look at the notion
of spacial outlier.
We first contrasted it, with the notion of
global outlier.
And we saw that in all, in many case,
these still give you different patterns.
Spatial outliers are a violation of, the
spatial smoothness of first law of
geography,
where as global outliers look at things
which are extreme values, either maximum
or minimum.
We also looked at several outlier
detection tests.
Some were visual and manual, and others
were algorithmic.
And finally, we notice that their
computational structure is the same
as spatial self-join, which we have seen
in the recording libraries.
So with this we will wrap up this video
segment.
In the next video segment we will look at
you know,
the fourth pattern family of co-locations,
which is related to association groups.
So I look forward to seeing you there.
Thank you.
