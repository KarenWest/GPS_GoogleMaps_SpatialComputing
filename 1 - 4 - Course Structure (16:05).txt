Hey folks.
Welcome back to
the spatial computing MOOC.
My job in this video is to go
over the course structure.
And the first thing in this video, you'll
notice, is a Learning Objectives slide.
You'll see this slide
in most of our videos.
It'll give you an understanding of what
you're going to learn in the video and
what you're going to learn
in the module overall.
So in this video we have number
of different learning objectives.
First we want you're going to,
by the end of this video know what
to expect each week in the course, so
both in terms of content and structure.
Next, this video will help you choose
your track, if you read the syllabus and
the read me first, which I highly
recommend doing you'll see that
there are three tracks in this course.
We'll go over what each track consists of,
and help you choose the,
the right track for your needs.
And by the end of this video you
will understand the course rules.
There are several, for instance we're not
going to allow any late problem sets.
And finally by the end of this video
you should know what's going to roughly
happen each week.
So you'll be able to plan your schedule
accordingly and work towards a suc,
the successful completion of this course.
Okay, speaking of course
schedule some basics.
As you probably know we started
on Tuesday, September 22nd.
We'll end Monday November 17th.
So this an eight week course, it's not
a full semester, it's half a semester.
In that, in those eight weeks,
we'll have eight modules.
One per week each module is going
to be quite self-contained.
And if you do want to know
more about Spatial Computing,
do come study with us at
the University of Minnesota.
We have a number of different courses
that will be of interest to you if you
like this MOOC.
Okay, what's happening in each module?
Well each module is going to consist
of a number of different things.
First and if you've taken them
before this will be quite obvious.
There will be a number of lecture videos,
this will range from maybe just two to
three videos to many more than that.
You shouldn't see more than two hours or
so of course video per module.
Each module will also have mandatory,
excuse me, mandatory course readings.
We will rely on you to independently
go to the readings websites which I'll
show you in a bit,
download the readings, read them.
They will be included in your problem set,
so
you'll definitely want to
make sure you do that.
Speaking of problems sets,
you'll have one to two each week
depending on the track you choose and for
those of you in the technical track there
will also be four assignments in total.
Okay.
Each module's going to have
a very consistent schedule, so
you will know what to expect.
The modules begin at Midnight our
time here in Minnesota on Tuesdays.
The modules, the modules end all, as you
might guess, at 11:59 p.m on Mondays.
And once more, I want to reiterate,
all times refer to.
By the time here in Minnesota.
During the course of this MOOC.
Unfortunately we have a little bit
of a time a point of confusion.
In the United States here we celebrate
something called Daylight Savings Time.
That means that Minnesota time actually
shifts while the MOOC is running.
Before November 2nd, we'll be UTC minus 5.
After November 2nd, we'll be UTC minus 6.
So the last couple of
modules in this course.
Unfortunately for many of you,
effectively in a different time zone.
Now the good news is that if you use
Cousera software to set your time zone,
you shouldn't have to
worry about any of this.
So, it should tell you when things
are due according to your local time.
So that's the good news.
Okay.
Moving onto module topics.
Again, we'll have eight modules, the first
one which is the one we're in right now,
is the introduction module, I'm, Dr.
Shekhar and I both teaching this one.
In week two, you'll get a,
a wonderful lecture and
a wonderful set of materials on
spatial query languages from Dr.
Shekhar, so this is learning
about how to access spatial data.
It is, you know, laying the foundation for
many of the other things that
we'll learn in the course.
Week 3 is spatial networks so
think routing and location based services.
So, for instance,
how can I design a system to find
the nearest pizza parlors to where I am?
Or understand the systems that I
use that do that functionality.
Week four, spatial data mining,
so you heard Dr.
Shekhar mention the famous
example in public health.
The Doctor John Snow in England doing,
doing effectively rudimentary 1800
style hot, hot spot detection.
Dr. Shekhar will show you how to do
that in a much more advanced way and
in a much more automated way, as well
as cover other topics in week four.
Starting in week five you'll
see me show up again.
I'm going to give you a lecture about
volunteered geographic information.
This is a fundamental
change in the type of data,
that we typically consider in spacial
computing so this is a fun lecture.
On week 6, we'll do a module on
positioning, so understanding, for
instance, how your smartphone
knows where you are.
On week seven, we'll do cartography and
geographic human-computer interaction, so
this is everything from making traditional
maps to making more interactive maps.
And then lastly this
is going to a fun one,
we'll talk, we'll cover future
directions in spatial computing.
So we'll talk about where we think things
are going, in the next five to ten years.
And then the course will be over.
Okay, group and individual work.
For the most part, we are going to want
you to work individually in this course.
Feel free to of course to study in groups.
Coursera does have a number of them.
Facilities to help you out with that,
I'll talk about that in a second.
All your problem sets, we expect that
you will do these individually in
accordance with Coursera's
honor honor code.
The technical track only for
those using the technical track
all assignments are going to be done
individually, just like the problem sets.
And do see the syllabus for
more information about a degroup and
individual work policy.
Okay.
Just to give you a,
a little bit of perspective here.
I know these things vary across the world.
But here in the United States,
we generally do take plagiarism and
copying, and these types of things,
quite seriously.
In fact, as we were recording this,
this module, a senator decided to
quit his Senate race because he copied
some stuff from his graduate thesis.
And that was discovered, and
this was such a big shame that he had
to quit, his big race for the senate.
So we do take these things kind of pretty
seriously here in the United States.
Okay.
The course has three tracks.
And we're going to go through these
tracks and, you're goal by the end
of the discussion here is to figure
out which track you want to take.
So the first track is the curiosity track.
Now this one's pretty simple.
It's targeted at people who
want to learn about one or
more spatial computing topics but
not the whole thing, right,
you don't want to commit to
the whole eight week course.
And for this track, of course,
no certificate can be given.
But you'll, of course,
get all the knowledge that you gain from
participating in the modules and watching
the videos and so on and so forth.
We have no prereqs for this, right.
?
We'll, prerequisites, excuse me,
we'll let you figure out what you can
do and, and I encourage you to do it.
Now the next track is what
we call the concepts track.
And in this track we're expecting folks.
Who want to be able to make informed
spatial computing decisions, maybe
understand what other folks who are more
technical in their company are doing or
just curious about how all these cool
new spatial computing technologies work.
And these are the folks we expect to be in
this track that will give a statement of
accomplishment if you
successfully complete the track,
I'll talk about grading a bit in a little.
And we do have a few prerequisites here.
Primarily that you have some
familiarity with online maps.
Or some familiarity with
spacial computing in general.
Nothing serious at all,
just that you, you know,
know what, know what's going
on when you do online routing.
These types of things.
Or excuse me.
You've participated in that,
you don't need to know what's going on.
We'll teach you what's going on.
And the time per week for
this one is, is pretty limited,
it's just two to four hours per week.
That's what we expect folks who
participate in the concept track to have
to commit this course to
successfully complete it.
Okay, the final track
is the technical track.
This is targeted at people with
a programming and a math background.
Not a very, you don't have to be a,
you know, a PhD computer scientist, but
we do expect a little bit of
programming and math experience.
You'll have programming assignments
on top of your problem sets.
We'll give you a distinguished
statement of accomplishment.
And we do have some prerequisites here and
that is we want you to have some
experience with Java most of
the assignments will be in Java and
a little web design experience as well.
And you'll need to have some roughly
pre calculus level math as well as
some basic statistics.
There's going to be a little
more work in technical track,
an additional two to three hours, not too
much but definitely a little more and
I do want to alert you to
the fact this this is an average.
So, some weeks you might have
maybe four to six more four to
six more hours of work.
Other weeks you'll have no additional work
at all relative to the concepts track.
Okay.
Let's talk about course deliverables,
so for the concepts track
students you'll have a very
clear deliverable each week and
that is a single problem set.
So you'll know that if you want to
complete the concepts track,
you can plan for
a single problem set each week.
Nothing more, and nothing less.
For the technical track students it
gets a little bit more complicated.
Some weeks you're going to have
an additional problem set on top of
the concepts track problem set.
So you'll be required to do
both of these problem sets.
And again in some weeks you'll also
have a hands on assignment as well.
So, which track should you choose?
Well, and this is of course up to you
entirely but I'm guessing it's going to
be your decision it's going to be some
function of the following factors.
One is the amount of
time you have available.
If you don't have the additional hours
to spend on the technical track.
Assignments and problem sets don't worry
about it, just do the concepts track.
Also your existing knowledge base and
skill set's going to figure in here,
right?
If you don't have any
experience programming,
we really recommend that you
don't try the technical track.
You don't need a ton of programming
experience but you do need some.
You'll have to decide how
much you want a certificate.
If you don't want a certificate,
just and you're interested in only
four of the modules,
just participate in four of the modules.
No harm done at all and
we'll be glad to to have you and
have you participate in the discussion and
so on and so forth.
The computer you have
available will matter,
I'll talk more about that in a second,
and then, you'll have of
course some other individual factors
that may figure into your decision.
Okay, speaking of computers,
we do have some system requirements for
this, this course, and
for the full details,
I'm actually going to refer you to the
syllabus and the readme first document.
But we'll just go over a couple
of high level points here.
For the con, the curiosity and concept
track, there are no system requirements,
this is just for the technical track.
So, if you are on the curiosity and
concepts track, you are doing,
you are doing fine.
Don't worry about it you just need
to run the coursera software.
For the technical track we
do have some requirements.
So, for instance, you have to have some,
an IDE,
an Integrated Development Environment or
some other way of running Java
software and so on and so forth.
We have attempted to make
assignments as accessible as
possible to a wide range of platforms.
We are not going to require
anything ridiculous, right?
We are not going to require for
instance that you have your own
Android smartphone or iOS smartphone.
That's not on the table we
do however expect that you
have some reasonable computing device and
you can read more details on the website.
I do want to point out that it,
it's your responsibility to install
the appropriate software and
make it, make sure it's working,
we'll help you through the process.
But it is your responsibility
we unfortunately can't
provide individual technical,
technical support.
There's some, you know, big problem
some platform change, you know,
these types of things we'll,
of course help you all out with that.
But if its an individual problem,
unfortunately we can't help you.
And we,
we actually can't give extra time or
make-up points or these types
of things for technical issues.
Okay.
Let's talk grading there are two parallel
points systems, and as you might guess.
There are, there's a point system for
the concept track and there's a point
system for the technical track.
Concept track points can only come
from concept track problem sets,
as you might guess.
And the technical track points only come
from technical track problem sets and
technical track assignments.
Now, if you're in the concept track,
super easy to understand,
right just do well on your problem sets.
If you're on the technical track, we do
expect you to pass the concepts track.
So I'll talk about what
passing means in a second,
as well as pass the technical track
in terms of the number of points.
Okay.
Speaking of which, for
the concepts track certificate,
we'll expect that you get
50% of concept track points.
Our goal here isn't to make this
very very difficult on you, right.
Our goal is to.
Help you learn.
And so we don't want to make you get,
you know, 99% of points.
Just 50% of points is all
we're going to require.
And for
the Technical Track Distinguished"Cert,
Certificate you'll also have to
get 50% of Technical Track points.
And this is a critical point.
If for some reason, you know,
you can't figure out an assignment.
Or you struggle with a number of
the Technical Track problem sets.
But you do well on
the the Concept Track problem sets,
we'll still give you a,
a regular certificate.
If you fail the technical track so,
not all will be lost.
A couple of final points about
grading unfortunately we
cannot accept any late problem sets or
assignments, so
you'll really have to pay
attention to those time zones.
Make sure you turn in your problem sets
and assignments before they're due.
Now Sasha and
I were students so long ago so
we do recall that,
that sometimes life intervenes, right?
Sometimes you have a family issue
sometimes you have to do, you know,
work for another class which has,
you know, assigned you tons and
tons of work, these types of things.
So we actually will forgive
the lowest the grade you
have on a problem set in each track.
so, if you do need to skip one
of the problem sets you can
do that without a penalty one time.
Okay, the last point is that all insi,
all assignments are required, so
this forgiveness policy does
not apply to assignments.
All right, some recipes for
success in this course.
We really recommend that you watch
the videos early in the week, so
the module will open on Tuesday
watch the videos on Tuesday or
Wednesday, you know, get,
get your mind around the material,.
Allow yourself some time to ask
questions in the discussion forum,
these types of things.
Don't leave the problem sets until the
very last minute, I think most of you who
have been students before know that's,
that, that's always a recipe for failure.
So please do try to do those earlier
again we cannot accept late problem sets.
And then lastly, please do make use of the
discussion forum on the Coursera website
on the left hand side of the website
you'll see a link to the discussion forum.
In many MOOCs this is a wonderful
community with all sorts of
folks asking questions,
you'll get answers from your classmates,
you'll get answers from
a TA we have who will be.
Quite active in the forum, and Dr.
Shekhar and I will both
participate in the forum as well.
Okay.
Last things, a couple of last things
here do look at the read me first and
the syllabus on the course website.
You can see the links here do
read those there's a lot of
important information in there.
I've covered a subset of it in this video,
but make sure you read those as well.
There is a separate reading website,
here is the URL.
Of course, there will be,
there will be a link on the,
the coursera web page as well.
This is where you're going to get you
know, get the links to the weekly
readings which are going to required and
will be covered on the problem sets.
We'll also point out cool resources
Perhaps some cool software for those in
the, those of you in the technical track,
current events, these types of things.
The discussion forum which we mentioned,
there is the link.
And social media we will have
a limited social media presence.
In particular through our Twitter account.
I'm @spatialcompmooc.
For those of who or in a couple week,
you'll take a look at the volunteer
geographic information lecture.
This Twitter account plays a key role in
that lecture which should get you excited.
It's a fun one.
And that's about it.
