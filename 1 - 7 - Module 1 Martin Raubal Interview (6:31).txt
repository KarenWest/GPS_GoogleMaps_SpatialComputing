Okay folks we're continuing
our series of interviews here.
I'm here with Martin Raubal
who is a professor of
Geo Information Engineering at ETH Zürich,
in Switzerland.
One of the best universities
in all of Europe.
Hi Martin, how are you doing?
>> Doing great.
Hi Brent.
>> So, I have a list of questions for
you here as you know, and the,
the first question I'm going to ask you
is just to explain to everyone your
research interest.
>> Okay, so basically, in my group we
focus on on you know two research issues.
The one has,
deals with cognitive engineering for
geographic information science.
So, basically bringing cognitive
aspects into the design of of
geo spatial services and tools.
And we also have a mobile eye-tracking
lab that is most people know static
eye-trackers that basically, where you can
you know, get sequences of gaze patterns.
And we're doing this research
with a mobile eye-tracker.
So, that means that we can go out in,
into the field.
And really find out you know, what is
really going on when people are trying to
solve their problems,
when they interact with mobile devices.
And that provides feedback to
the design of these tools.
The second area is actually how to use
geographic information systems for
energy types of energy.
Meaning that, you know,
if you do renewable energy planning,
you create the new wind park that has
to be connected to the energy network.
So, we do transmission
line planning there,
in terms of a multi-criteria
decision analysis.
And we also focus on spacial-temporal
optimization problems.
How to locate biomass power plants,
et cetera.
>> Okay.
So, the second question I had was can you
tell me a bit about how you began
working in the spatial computing or
the geographic information area?
>> Well I have to start
a little bit earlier there.
Because when I graduated from high
school I actually wanted to study law.
And in the vacation before
starting the study,
I was trying to find a job to pay for
my travels.
And so another job at this survey,
the local surveying office and
this is how I you know, came familiar
with surveying engineering, and I think
one week before the semester started I
decided to study surveying engineering.
And then when I did that, actually I
became a teaching assistant, and it was
the time when my professor Andrew Frank
came to Vienna and started the GS program.
And this is how I ended up GIS.
You know went to the U.S for
a Master's degree.
Did a PhD in chi information and that's
how I got into the area of spatial things,
spatial engineering, spatial computing.
>> You have one of my favorite stories
about finding finding spatial computing.
[LAUGH]
>> Yeah.
>> okay.
So, what do you think has been
the most important new technology or
research paper, in the spatial
computing area in the past few years?
>> That's a difficult question.
I, I wouldn't want to limit myself
to naming one particular thing.
because, you know, when they came
up with location based services,
they were always talking
about the kill application.
And I was always wondering, why are you
looking for the kill application?
It's already there.
It's navigation systems.
So last couple of years, I would still say
that location based services is really
something that has,
you know, brought some new
ideas into the spatial computing area, and
it, it actually already went mainstream.
But in terms of of the, the progress and
development there in the area,
I think, it's some of the new
interaction modes that fascinate me.
So it's, you know,
what are your instructions?
It's just interacting with various
tools with this system, and
this whole area that you're quite familiar
with, the Chiwage CI this integration of.
Chi is spatial stuff as we name it.
And human computer direction.
>> Well Martin you've given a great
preview of module seven of the course.
We'll be dedicating a whole module to
geographic human computer interaction.
So, thank you.
>> Very good.
>> I'll pay you later.
Okay [LAUGH] next up I was wondering if
you could talk a bit about about
the project you're working on, right now.
That has you particularly excited.
>> Yeah I started my job here
about three and a half years ago.
And you know, I, I always worked in the
area of spacial commission and wayfinding.
And, one particular problem
there was if we wanted to
find out where people
made wayfinding errors.
There were certain methods
that you could apply.
Like, you know, watching people,
measuring some kind of stuff.
But we never,
there was always the question of
where did people have problems.
But we never could get to the question
of why people had these problems.
So, my idea was to come up with the Mobile
Eye-Tracking lab here at ETH Zürich.
And I think that actually is very
exciting for me and for my group.
Because that gives us some ideas about,
why do we have peop, why do
people have problems during interaction
with mobile systems or during way finding.
So and we combine that with
location functionality so
we can actually call it location
aware mobile Eye-Tracking.
Because at the same time,
when we know where people are looking at,
we know where they are.
And we know when they'll look at
like landmarks during wave finding,
when they look at their mobile device,
when they need help,
when a decision point is very complex.
And we can get a lot of this information
just from the gaze patterns alone.
So, by looking at the gaze
patterns we can automatically.
Find out where the people are lost,
whether they have problems with
orientation with finding landmarks and so
on, so, this whole map matching process.
And I think mobile ad tracking brought
really a new perspective into my research,
which I am quite excited about.
>> Yeah, some of that work coming out of
your group is really quite impressive.
the, the paper at the workshop last year,
I very much enjoyed.
Well, thank you Martin for your time.
You're welcome, Brent.
It's nice talking to you.
