Welcome back to the discussion
of spatial computing.
Today we are going to meet Professor Wan
Bae at University of Wisconsin-Stout.
And she has been working on some
very exciting research projects in
spatial computing relating to
environmental health and asthma, okay.
So please say hello to Professor Wan Bae.
Hello, Anna.
>> Hi, Dr. Shetkar.
How are you?
>> Hi, it's very nice to see you.
>> Nice to see you.
>> And thank you for
taking time away from your busy schedule.
I know you have an SF Grant
proposal pending.
>> It's my pleasure.
>> So a short deadline, so
I really appreciate you
taking the time and sharing.
Your enthusiasm about spatial computing
with all the students in this course.
So, the first question we wanted
to ask you is that, you know,
your undergraduate degree is in
architecture, which is you know.
It's not obvious what the connection
to spatial computing may be.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So, would you share how you you know
got started with spatial computing?
>> After my college Degree in
Architectural Engineering,
I started working in a company and
acted to form Samsung.
>> Okay.
>> And I worked in a high risk building.
And mainly I focused on
the building design.
>> Uh-huh.
>> But, I stand over my career.
And I do work, I did some work
on the building management.
>> I see.
>> There were lots of databases involved,
and also the, you know,
facility management systems as well.
>> All right.
>> So I was quite in, pleased then,
to involved in the project.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And very interest in some
computing feature.
>> Okay.
>> That's the motivation I came to America
to study.
Computer Science in Master and the Ph.D.
>> Neat, neat.
So where this database is spatial?
Did you have two dimensional or third?
>> Spatial databases.
And although it's a indoor mainly.
>> Okay.
>> And at that time, there is no such
a concept of a indoor computing.
>> Okay.
>> Everything systems.
>> All right.
>> Although there were
pure mechanical engineering,
electrical engineering,
they have a systems to manage those
equipments and possibilities, but but
not in computer science
>> Okay, okay wonderful.
So, what kind of things
are you working on nowadays?
>> My thesis was based on online
quality processing and GIS.
>> Okay.
>> And I did some active special
joint [INAUDIBLE] range inquiries,
and those particular data structures and
items.
>> Right.
>> And, then I joined the this
university then and I work
on something relationship between
computing and medical theory.
And the coolant project I am involved
in is that in asthma monitoring system.
>> Okay.
>> In which I had a collaborators in
United Arab Emirates.
>> Okay.
>> University, and
then we're working on the data models and
algorithms to Provide individual
health care for the asthma patient.
>> So what are some special computing
aspects of understanding asthma and
helping asthma patients?
>> So there is a term,
which is the you know,
medic you know kind of
the term medical doctors used.
They want to know like if backup
would imbalance the factors
on And what a interesting thing
about the asthma is that
>> Mm-hm.
>> Individual patients they has
different symptoms and triggers.
>> Okay.
>> And those triggers,
is the based on the imbalanced factors.
As you know, the imbalanced data,
there is time and location.
>> Okay.
>> So there is lots of what, you know,
the computing involved in maps.
>> Okay.
>> And special data sets.
>> Okay, wonderful.
So in this course you know,
we are going to talk about spatial data
mining where you have
patterns like hot spots.
>> Mm-hm.
>> Or you can correlate some environmental
factors with disease and so on.
So do you have any special data
analytics aspects in your project?
>> It is.
At the current,
the beginning of the project we
focus on measuring of the exporter
of the individual and then we implement
algorithms to estimate exporter time.
>> Okay, okay.
>> Then there are lots of
special [INAUDIBLE] and
ingredients that we have to develop.
Then, those data is collected and
after the [INAUDIBLE] the patient's data
will be collected in,
starting this December.
>> All right.
>> Then, we need to develop the new data
mining tools, or best data mining tools
to find out the relationship between
exposure time and the human head.
At the same time, what are they, or
how much, you know, of the percentage of,
you know,
influence of each of the data sets.
[INAUDIBLE] In terms of the human head.
>> Wonderful.
>> So, there is lots of data mining.
The item we used to implement in a,
in a, in a developed.
And at the same time prediction model,
along with the individual the behavior
model need to be developed.
>> Wonderful so so
why this collaboration with the UAE.
Are there some unique expertise or
collaborations there that made you.
Situate the project in
collaboration with the UAE.
>> What's the point here, UAE and has the
problem with the impact of the factors,
for example the asthma, the mortality
rate is very high, and as you know,
higher as the, the United States.
And they have very extreme
weather conditions.
>> Okay.
>> Which is like very high humidity, and
high temperature in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
>> Okay.
>> And at the same time,
most of the people stay in a house.
>> Okay.
>> Which is very, very, you know,
you know cool under air condition.
So, Shows that the people stay inside,
which is air conditioned the condition.
They have, you know, susceptibility
to the extreme weather conditions.
>> Right.
>> So that's the one of the motivation.
>> Okay.
>> And second motivation about
data availability in the states,
it's very harder to
Collect the patient's data and
research on the, the, those data set.
Whether UA be.
>> Why, why is that?
[LAUGH].
>> It's very restricted of,
about the privacy and security.
>> So it's the HIPPA regulations then.
>> Right and but UAE is a kind of
a you know, a little lousy way of
policies of data sets which is another
you know, motivation we collaborate.
>> Very okay, wonderful.
[CROSSTALK].
>> The only point is that
that between two communities,
which is the medical field researchers and
computer scientists.
And we have some gaps between
those two communities.
>> Okay.
>> We use different languages,
the way we see the problems
that There wasn't workshop
between those a two communities.
And then we had to very
successful at researching
>> Very wonderful.
Now this was an excellent workshop
sponsored by National Science Foundation.
>> Right.
>> Thank you for organizing.
So looking ahead next five to seven years,
wha, what do you see
as the major research directions
in this project and in the field.
>> I think it I my specialty is the GIS,
and
especially they algorithms and joints,
send in their drawings and their.
But my group is the loaning
to a data mining algorithms.
>> Okay.
>> So the first three years that we
do some modeling and
algorithms about their special joints.
>> Okay.
>> Then next three years that we spend
most of the time on data mining tools and
development.
They are wonderful, wonderful.
>> Mm-hm.
>> You mentioned Exposume and
what is that and what is its future?
>> Exposume is a study of what the effect
of [INAUDIBLE] that factors on human hair.
>> Okay.
>> So, it could be very short,
time period.
>> Uh-huh.
>> For example, asthma, you.
Patient exposed in
a surgeon like a smoker.
[INAUDIBLE].
>> And they got attack.
>> Yeah.
>> Or exposing could be like a very, you
know, long life period which is a cancer.
>> Right, right.
[NOISE].
>> So timing tables of
the patient's monitoring are required.
>> All right.
>> And to expose them to
words is just a study in 2006
>> Okay.
So, it's quite new fears and there is
a lot of problems over measurement, and
on the modeling, and algorithms.
>> Wonderful.
And one last question, most of us
are used to having GPS on smartphones and
the cars and so on.
>> Mm-hm.
>> But your group and
your neighbor in Asthmapolis.
>> Mm-hm.
>> They were putting GPS on inhalers used
by asthma patients.
>> Right, right.
>> So do you do you see more use of GPS
with sensors to monitor personal health,
and environmental health in coming years?
>> Right.
So asthma patients are recommended
to carry inhalers.
And also they use
the [INAUDIBLE] gauge everyday.
Those two are the main.
It could not afford those
a patients need to carry.
>> All right.
>> And so, we developed new sensors.
>> Okay.
>> That is very a tiny,
tiny microprocessor that is fit in.
And inhaler.
This is a kind of what inhaler,
the U.S and U.A patients use.
>> Right.
>> So we developed a small cap.
>> All right.
>> That actually come with this inhaler.
>> Okay.
>> Whenever the patient to
pushes the inhaler button.
We measure the time and location.
>> Okay.
>> And also how long it actually pressed,
so that, and
doctors know when the patient is
properly used [INAUDIBLE] as well.
>> Okay.
>> So, it can be used today and.
And there is in our location and time.
Exposure time.
At the same time, it can be used to,
for the patient's training.
>> Yeah.
Okay.
Wonderful.
>> And this data is going to
be transport you know,
you just the patient's mobile phone.
>> Okay.
>> And then we store this one
in a secure so that put a,
you know, data analysis later.
>> Yeah, wonderful.
So, personal health may be a big area for
spatial computing.
>> Right.
>> We move forwards.
>> Yeah, and we could, this is
the individual, again, had the care.
>> The care, okay.
>> So, most of the doctors in
the current research in medical field,
they use the average of this, you know,
some of the symptoms, the average
of their temperature, and so on.
But more likely people are,
their reaction,
their symptoms could have varied
based on the individual symptoms.
So this is what we want to do, provide
the individual the cure of their you know,
health and systems.
>> Wonderful.
So thank you so much Joan for
sharing you know your exciting project,
which is clearly very futuristic
>> Thank you.
>> And we appreciate you know,
with despite your answer,
proposal deadline, and we, we wish you
lot of success with this project and.
>> Thank you so much.
>> Great.
>> Thank you.
>> Wonderful.
This was Professor Von Veigh,
from University of Wisconsin Stout.
Sharing her excitement about
use of spatial computing
to improve personalized health.
So when we come back in next interviews,
we'll meet with a few other
community members and
share in their excitement of using spatial
computing for different society problems.
Thank you.
