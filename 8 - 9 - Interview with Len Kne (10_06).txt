Welcome back to the discussion
of spatial computing.
Today we are going to meet Mr. Len Kne.
And he's spearheading a very interesting
project at the University of
Minnesota campus called U-Spatial,
which is a shared resource for
many, many departments and colleges.
And I'd say, part of a trend,
at least nationwide in US, and
maybe even in other countries,
to create such resources.
So without further ado,
lets welcome Mr. Len Klie.
Hi, Len.
>> HI, thanks for having me.
>> Wonderful.
So first question I wanted to ask you
was I understand your undergraduate.
Focus was in recreational studies.
>> Mm-hm.
>> From there how did you come
to spatial computing or GIS?
>> Yeah.
Kind of a long road.
I actually most of my career has
been in information technologies and
When I got finished my undergrad
degree I started working for
a major park district doing research.
Studying how people use the parks, doing
needs assessments and that type of thing.
And this was back in the mid 80s.
I had the first personal computer for
the park district, and so in order to
do my job I started learning more and
more about information technology
which got me into that.
But one of things we used to do is
map how people used recreation areas.
We did this with paper and pencil and
if we wanted to analyze it.
We had to page through all the papers
to get the information out of it.
And that stuck with me for
20 years and in 2005 I returned and
got a masters in geo, geographic
information science, partially so
I could start working with some
of the paper, non digital work.
So I thank CGIS from the,
the technology side of it.
>> Wonderful.
So what kind of things
are you working on nowadays?
>> Okay, you had mentioned u-spatial.
That, that's my main, main focus.
Our tag line is support for
spatial research which provides services
throughout the University of Minnesota.
Uh,for researchers, for grad students and
for students who are working on projects.
This involves things like a help desk if
they have any questions we do a lot of
trainings and then we do almost
a consulting type business that help
researchers out when they
need help with spatial.
>> Wonderful.
So, so do they need help with for example
different data sets such as census or
different map layers?
>> Yes.
Yeah, a lot of, the,
the hardest thing I think with getting
into GIS and we see it with people who
are not working with it regularly
is finding the data to begin with.
And then once they find the data they've
gotta get it into a format that they can
get into the software.
Get into the program to work with it and
that's hard when you first.
>> Wonderful, yeah,
certainly there hundreds and
hundreds of map layers,
mapping everything.
Mm-hm.
And
I just learned looks like parks
are being mapped as well.
>> Yes.
>> And then these data sources
I guess it's not as trivial as
just taking two data sets and
putting them together.
I mean,
what else users have to know about?
Are the coordinate systems
different across data sets,
or what are the challenges in pulling
different data sites together?
>> Certainly.
Yeah, projections you know, are huge.
How do you you know,
flatten out the world, right?
It's round, so
we're going to have different projections.
As wonderful as the web
mercaters projection is for
the web map, it's not always so
great for doing spacial analysis.
Other things they need to look for
is the metadata, you need to look at
how is the original data collected?
And what was its purpose?
You know, did they ha,
what's the accuracy of it?
Will it work for your needs, versus
what the original collection was done?
>> Neat, neat.
And what kind of
software do they come to seek help on?
I mean, isn't Google map enough?
[LAUGH] For a lot of things it is.
We, we do a lot of work with Google Maps.
At the University of Minnesota, we have
a site license with the Azuri products.
And that makes it very attractive for
our researchers to use.
It's very inexpensive.
So we've got people using
the desktop version.
And more and more are using ArcGIS Online.
The web version, so
they don't have to learn.
>> right.
>> This fairly large software
package to do the work.
>> Yeah, wonderful.
And and in terms of training,
what kind of things,
I mean is it mostly for
learning Esri Arc software or
do they also learn other things
like census datasets and so on?
>> Yeah, our, our focus is
primarily on the technologies.
>> Okay.
>> There are groups on campus that'll work
with more of the data sets, so the
Minnesota population center will focus on
census information, so yeah we're trying
to learn a little, teach a little bit
about spatial, and a little bit about
the software, so they can get going.
>> Great, great.
And then, where do your users come from?
Are they primarily from
geography department?
Or do they come from
elsewhere in the city?
>> Yeah,
very few are from geography these days.
>> Oh, okay.
>> And, and that's one of
the neat things we're seeing with,
with spatial information.
It's from public health, it's from that
medicine, it's from the business school.
>> Wow.
We're seeing more and more from the
Humanities, as far as religious studies,
and even music are starting
to use spatial information.
>> What would religious
studies do with maps?
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, so I've got one
project that, somebody was looking at,
how congregations interacted
in the 1850's to 1900's.
In Minneapolis St Paul and the churches,
the locations stay the same, but
the congregations and
the people change regularly.
So they're, they're looking at
spatially how do they interact?
>> Interesting.
Wow.
So if you know, spatial computing and
data set services are so
so much needed by so
many disciplines in
University of Minnesota.
Is that the case in other universities,
and are they providing similar services?
>> It, it certainly is.
>> Right.
>> It, it's growing across.
>> Okay.
>> A lot of the large
universities are starting to provide
GIS remote sensing special services
across the campus because it, it's,
it's very transdisciplinary by nature.
>> Right.
>> Some have maybe more defined centers
in this spatial or more of an umbrella.
>> Okay, okay.
>> Places like Harvard or Santa Barbra.
>> Okay, okay.
>> Have well established centers.
But most universities are doing that and
we're also seeing if
the small universities-
>> Okay.
>> Are often providing services through
the library.
>> Oh, very neat.
So hearing Harvard
that's very interesting.
because it's coming full circle,
because in roughly in mid 1960s.
It was the hardware
graphics lab when Jack-
>> Mm-hm.
>> Benjamin and
any founders of ESRI used to work.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And Howard felt it was
not again big enough for
us to get to leave [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH]
>> And that
became a billion dollar company.
>> Yeah.
>> And now they are back.
They brought GIS Services on campus now.
>> They do, yeah.
>> Very, very interesting.
A great.
So what do you see the future
of these services?
I mean, do you see this growing
on many other campuses?
Do you see these you know, where is
the patient services on campus going?
>> Yeah, a for, for Minnesota.
Again it's, it's expanding to,
I think all disciplines on campus.
we're, we're certainly growing in
some of the big data needs and
those types of products, projects.
But it's mostly,
other disciplines picking it up and
working collaboratively with,
between multiple departments.
>> Okay.
Won, wonderful.
So, you know,
I have interesting analogy, you know,
and I was in undergraduate school or
earlier.
Many campuses had a computer center,
which was a shared resource.
>> Mm-hm.
>> People who wanted to use big computing
would come there for help, and then it
slowly grew into a graduate program and
then departments and now it's a very very
vibrant, disciplined, and large industry.
>> Yeah.
>> Do you see similar analogy with GIS.
Said with centers that do you see
this precursor to becoming, you know,
bigger things, on campus?
>> I, I do, I think it, I think it will,
I think that there's the idea of this
spatial university where you integrate GIS
remote sensing throughout much of the
University and it will continue to grow.
And in a way we make use of
a lot of other resources such as
the super computing center and
other resources to do that.
>> Wonderful, great.
So so thinking about the audience you
know, in this class we have almost
20,000 you know, participants and many are
from, you know, many different countries.
And in some countries
the universities may not have
started a spatial
computing services group.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So let's say if they were interested
in thinking about creating simpler,
similar services in their universities or
collection of universities,
what advice would you give them and
how can they start?
>> Yeah.
The, the key is in the people.
You've gotta get people talking and
working together.
It took.
>> Okay.
>> Probably a decade to get the idea of
U-Spatial going on the university here.
it's, it's working together,
thinking about making connections
with disciplines that you
wouldn't normally work with.
So geography is easy but
religious studies, history.
You don't think about those connections so
much.
and, and look for the,
the tools that are out there.
There's a wide range of open source
tools that work very, very well.
>> Wonderful.
So that's a wonderful place
to close because Harvard,
the [INAUDIBLE] historian, right?
>> Mm-hm.
>> And some people say there is
no history without geography and
there is no geography without history,
right?
>> Yeah.
Wonderful.
So, we thank Mr. Len Kenny,
who heads the spatial computing services
on the University of Minnesota campus,
which is a valuable resource.
And he shared how this is happening
at many other university campuses
because the GIS data sets tools and
services are becoming very,
very useful in many disciplines.
So in the next interview, we'll meet
a few other community members and
get a sense of what's happening
in the community in general.
Thank you for your attention.
We look forward to seeing you soon
