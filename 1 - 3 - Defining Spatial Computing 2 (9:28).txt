Welcome back.
In the last video we talked about a few
central questions in spatial computing and
we gave you a bunch of examples.
In this particular video, we'll talk
about the user groups, or the customers.
So in recent history and
currently who are the people who
are using spatial computing.
So first, you know, we'll,
we'll point out to the business.
Okay.
So there are a lot of consumer to
consumer applications and, you know,
business to consumer applications,
which benefit form spacial computing.
And one way to give a sense of
the magnitude of business is to
share with you a recent
report form McKinsey,
which is a very respected consulting
institution in the business world.
Right?
And they wrote a report on big data.
And in this report 2011s report,
they dedicated a whole chapter
to location based services.
And I want to point out, you know,
a small quotation about this report,
this is from a New York Times
article which summarized the report.
And in this, I wanted to point
out two different things.
Okay.
First, the magnitude.
So you notice that McKinsey estimated that
will have 600 billion dollar per year,
you know, of a value, just derived out of
all the location trace data sites that
are coming out from applications
like four square and loop.
And many of these you can think of them
as volunteer geography information that
Brent mentioned.
And later in the course,
you will see this in a lot more detail.
Okay?
So business,
businesses do use spatial computing.
In fact, you know,
if you will notice the new logo of IBM,
one of the largest computer company.
It actually looks like a globe and
they have a label called smarter planning.
So even big computer
companies that in this space.
Certainly, Google is in this space and
so on, and a little later I will
show you examples of those.
Okay.
But in terms of category, let me also
mention that it's also used by government.
The many different branches of government
need geographic information because they
often manage very large geographic areas.
Okay?
So here is a,
a picture from congressional report.
So U.S. Congress was briefed on this
technology recently, and in this report,
they listed all the U.S.
departments in, of government which use
spatial computing and they're member
of this geographic data committee.
So let me mention a couple
of them very quickly.
We talked about this
cholera epidemic in London.
So, you can imagine that public health,
which is under department of Health and
Human Services is very interested,
and that is indeed true.
In fact, as this video is being recorded,
many people are very concerned about
spread of Ebola virus in Africa.
And some of the people who are traveling
from there to United States and
other places, and you probably
know Center for Disease Control.
It's actually tracking the locations of
these disease, which is what they do for
all infectious disease, and
they try to contain the geographic spread.
Okay.
Another classical sponsor has been
the Department of Defense.
In fact, there is a saying and, you know,
a lot of that you have probably seen the
recent warfare, which is very asymmetric.
Right?
So the adversaries are often very,
very unconventional.
You don't know where their facilities are,
and if you don't know their locations,
what good are your weapons?
Right?
So people often say that maps are as
important as soldiers, as weapons.
Right?
So clearly, in many,
many different countries,
Department of Defense is a big user
of maps and big producer of maps.
In fact, some of the most accurate
maps of the world exists where we
have had warfare.
Okay?
And, and so on.
You know, Department of Transportation.
We all use navigation application.
And as you can imagine,
lot of this was driven by projects from
Department of Transportation and so on.
Emergency Management is another one.
We talked about hurricane Katrina.
They often have mapping done right after
disaster to help people, and so on.
Okay?
So, let's go and
get a little bit more specific.
So I'll, what I'm going to do now is
to show you actual companies and so on.
You know, who have used this technology
to convey a sense that, you know,
our lives have been impacted
a lot by spatial computing.
You probably are already using it,
but it's probably hard for
you to imagine that 20, 30 years ago,
it was a much more niche technology and
the set of consumers were fewer.
Okay.
So, so if I go back, 20 years ago,
then the types of products that you would
have seen are shown on the left-hand side.
Okay?
You would have seen ESRI,
Environmental Systems Research Institute.
And their popular family
of product called Arc, and
there is a number of
products underneath that.
This is used quite a bit in almost all
geography departments, and more and
more facility management and
asset management, they use this.
This is the richest set of software,
you can make very sophisticated map and
do nice cartography and
projections out of it.
But they were niche products, as well.
You know,
SaTScan came out of public health.
This came out of National Cancer Institute
in order to find hot spots, so
geographic areas of high
concentration of a disease.
And now, the similar techniques have moved
to police departments for crime hot spots.
You see Oracle Spatial.
So in SQL word, people added a library,
to allow storage of data and
querying in this world.
And even IBM got on this,
you know, in a few years later and
they do a lot of consulting in this world.
Okay?
But this has been changing.
In fact, many of you probably
haven't seen those products.
That's the story of 1990s.
What many of you have been seeing and,
you know, as Greg was mentioning
are product of this kind.
So you have probably seen your
smartphone and navigation application.
Some of you may still
have these GPS devices,
which were really a craze,
you know, about five years ago.
[LAUGH] But the smartphone is sort of,
you know, dampening them down.
So unless, you are really in outdoor
navigation in mountains or lakes.
Probably all you are doing is smartphone,
but if you are going outdoors where you
don't have as much GPS signal,
you know, mountain valleys and
so on, you will see this other
dedicated device or even paper maps.
And then, you see these volunteer
geographic information.
Waze was just purchased by Google and
this collects, you know,
it help you know, it encourages
volunteers to report traffic information.
And using Waze you can,
actually know, where police cars are if
you care, not only where [INAUDIBLE].
[LAUGH] But there are more serious things
like Usnakihidi, which came out of Kenya.
And this allowed people to
report on elections and
other disturbances where
the traditional journalist cannot go.
But if you watch something
through a smartphone app,
you can tell the location and describe it.
OpenStreetMap revolutionized
the mapping itself.
Even Google switched to this technology,
where you allow volunteers to
take a satellite imagery and
mark approach and name them and so on.
Okay?
So it has changed.
And there's another thing
we want to convey to you.
The traditional view which
many of us still have.
You know, [INAUDIBLE] that GIS
was a niche technology and
it was used only by people
who were already trained.
They needed a degree in
geography to use it.
Not anymore.
All of us now use it because we have
these nice services on the web and
apps on the phone.
Okay?
But what you miss, what may surprise
you even more is the following.
Back in 90s,
Macs were made by trained people and
they maintained very high quality.
And today, lots of us are making Mac.
Probably, you are making Mac too,
and you may say, well, maybe not.
But if you are using a smartphone,
which runs either Android or, you know,
the Apple's operating system,
iPhone and you leave your GPS on.
You are making maps because your
locations are being collected and
shared and
they are being used to improve maps.
Okay?
And this is affecting the software.
So back in 90s, there was specialized
software like Arc or this Oracle Spatial.
But today, many other layers of your
software are incorporating spatial things.
So even your smartphone,
you would have essentially a location in
open location service
to get your location.
If you have HTML5, which is a language
on the web, it supports location.
Even the internet protocol,
the next generation, you know,
is supporting location.
So all layers of software
are becoming location aware.
Okay?
And the expectations are rising.
You know, more and
more people know about the locations.
They want to do more things with it,
right?
At the same time risks are also rising.
Probably, some of you may find it creepy
that your cellphone locations are being
collected, or your car locations are being
collected if you have a GPS device and
you're in there.
The laws and the policies and
our expectations haven't kept pace.
In some countries like European Union are
taking the lead in making laws but, but
lot more has to happen if it, for
these, you know, you, if you you know,
some people call it geoslavery, you know,
some people are worried about you know,
being followed by undesirable elements and
so on.
You know, those things have to grow.
Okay.
So again, the sense I wanted
to convey is the following.
Spatial computing is no
longer a niche area.
It's being used by all of us.
There are a lot of great products and
many other new things can
happen in the coming years.
certainly, it will affect society
in areas beyond technology.
Our laws and policies have to evolve.
Okay.
So people have been also
thinking about it, you know,
there was a recent workshop at national
academy to flesh out these research issues
and in the coming year, you know, the
research community will be shaping this,
policy community will be shaping this.
And I sincerely hope some of you taking
this course will kind of get excited and
be an active participant and shape it,
you know, and for years to come.
Thank you for your attention and
in the next few videos we'll come and
def, you know, delve into some of these
topics in a little bit more detail.
