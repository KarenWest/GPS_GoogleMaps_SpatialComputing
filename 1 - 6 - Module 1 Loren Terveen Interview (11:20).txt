Hey, folks!
Welcome back to our series of interviews,
with experts in the spatial
computing field.
Today I'm here with my colleague,
Loren Terveen.
He is a professor [SOUND] in,
my department,
the Computer Science Department here
at the University of Minnesota.
And he's been doing some great
spatial computing work now for
about ten years or so.
Is that, is that right.
Okay.
So Loren, I my first question for
you is just if you could tell us
all about your research interests.
>> Well, good to talk to you, Brent.
I guess I've been, as you said,
working for about a decade in the field.
I started out about ten years ago.
Exploring the,
the first wave of technology that let's
you do location based work on cell phones.
So these were not widespread then,
but we actually, bought a bunch of,
think they were Nextel phones,
that were GPS enabled.
And we gave them to people and
ran some experiments with them,
where we tracked people's location and
we tried to make inferences about.
What were the places they went too,
what were the patterns and movements?
And we also developed a location
based messaging system,
a personal messaging system,
where people could associate messages
with places that were important to them.
Or were useful to them,
like location based messages to
do errands like buy groceries, or
picking something up for somebody.
So I did that about ten years ago.
And then starting about seven or
eight years ago I actually did work on a,
on a geographic wiki for bicyclists.
It's called Cyclopath.
And this is a system we've
continued to work on.
And the really interesting thing about
Cyclopath is, it does routing for
bicyclists just as you have systems
like Google Maps that do routing,
now today, for
bicyclists as well as motorists.
But it also is a geographic wiki,
and it came out, as I said,
about six or seven years ago,
so we did a lot of exploration.
Into this the nature of,
geographic editing for, this domain.
And more recently, we've actually
been developing a system for
location and
based in mobile crowd sourcing.
We call this folk source and it's a system
that will let anyone who has a need to
collect data out in the field
to create a campaign.
For example, you know?
People who want to monitor
the health of trees in the city.
Which is sort of important around here,
where we have some tree diseases.
Can, can create a campaign that says,
basically, we'd like people to,
take pictures of certain types of trees.
Send those in, maybe fill out a brief
survey for each picture they take.
And it's a great way to do distributed
data collection campaigns.
For all of these.
For all of these things, we explore both
the technology that you need to make
things work, like what changes you need to
make to Wikis to support geographic based,
instead of text based editing.
As well as a lot of social dynamic issues.
How do people work with
these technologies?
How do they cooperate?
What sorts of problems are there?
What sort of motivation or
incentive structures do you need
to get people to participate?
So, we do both technology and
behavioral work.
>> You know, one of the things I really
like about your work, Loren, is that you
manage to integrate really interesting
research questions, and research projects
with systems that actually affect people,
and help people here in the Twin Cities.
And, Cyclopath was launched in
the Twin Cities metro area.
Thousands of users, right?
In these types of things.
>> Yeah, yeah.
>> And then folk sources
aiming to do the same thing.
So I, I just think that's wonderful.
So next question can you tell me a bit
about how you got started in
the spacial computing domain?
I know you mentioned your,
your first projects, but
what, what inspired you interest?
[SOUND] I'm trying to think what
actually really inspired my interest.
I think just a belief that the technology
was going to be transformative,
that if you, if you knew more about
the context that people were in,
particular their location.
You could do things that you just
couldn't do otherwise, and so
I was just really intrigued by that.
I mean as you know Brent, in the research
peep, field people have been
looking into the value if location for
15 or 20 years or more.
But, up until a little over a decade ago.
If you wanted to do any
technical explorations,
you had to actually build your own
hardware, and that's not my kind of thing.
>> Right, right.
>> I don't have the skills and also, if
you do that, you can't really, you can't
really do anything practical, you can't
see how people will really use it.
So, as the technology started
to mature a little bit.
So, that you could buy commercially
systems that would be location based.
My interest in what you could
do with these things or
what people would do with things really
came to a peak and I said, let's try it.
So, I think that the sort of ripening
of technology led me to want to do it,
and I really wanted to see things like.
How will people use this socially?
You know.
If you know people's locations can you
do interesting things like, you know,
find out where your friends are, and
this is something people have been
thinking about for 15 plus years and
are, you know, now it's getting
out into the commercial world.
It's still not clear to me if
it's going to be successful.
But one of the things we
were interested in early on.
Was can we build systems,
that are aware of location and
then can help people sort of collaborate
and work together around that.
We talked about an idea of letting people,
request favors or
little errands they want run.
You know like anybody who's in my area,
you know, I, I have a hard
time getting out, could you get some
groceries for me if you're at the store?
And if it's a neighbor or somebody you
know, you might be happy to do it,
or even something as mundane as, you know,
if you're working late at the office, and
somebody, one of your friends or
contacts, is going by the coffee shop,
maybe they can see, hey, you know.
I could use some coffee and
they'll, they'll get it for you.
So yeah, we had some ideas that we thought
would be really cool, the technology
started to get just mature enough that
we thought we could explore them.
So that's why I got into it.
>> You know, one of the things you,
you One of the things that came to mind
while you were talking there is how
important early research on these
new devices that aren't quite practical
yet can really inform the future I mean.
What you just talked about is, is so
much of what we call crowd sourcing and
the peer economy today, right?
>> Absolutely.
>> And
your early work definitely speaks to that.
Okay, next question.
What do you think has been the most
important new spacial computing
technology or
research project over the past few years?
>> You know, that's an interesting one,
and I'm going to give I think
I'm going to answer a different question
or refuse to answer that question.
>> That's fair enough.
That's, it's the academic tradition.
>> Yeah.
[LAUGH] And here's why.
I actually think the most important thing,
at least in my mind that's happened
over the last few years has been
the really widespread penetration
of devices that are location aware.
Even a few years ago not
everyone had a smart phone.
I myself got one maybe three years ago,
and I was not an early adapter but
I wasn't among the latest adapters.
But now everybody has smart
phones that are location aware.
And so I think what excites me
about that is a lot of these ideas
that have been around in
the research community for 15 or
20 years that first required you
to build custom hardware, and
then required you to use hardware that
was commercial but not widely used.
Now can be explored on
ubiquitous hardware.
And so some of these ideas you know,
proximity based matching, hey,
get together with your friends or
get together with people who share your
interests who happen to be close to you.
May not be good ideas, but
they've been kicking around for
a while, and now I think we can really
explore them and see what's going to work.
A slightly more
a slightly more responsive answer to
your question would be, I think some of
the augmented reality stuff is
going to be really interesting too.
Some of the goggles, or
even just the cell phone based systems.
That will show you, you know,
overlays of what's going on or
what's relevant to the world around you.
I think that's really interesting
again an idea that's been around for
a while, but that technology is only,
you know is coming out even later
than the pure location based stuff.
So I think that, just the wide spread
ubiquity of location based and now may
be some of the VR in reality technologies
is what am most excited about.
>> Well,
you claim not to answer my question, but
I think you did a pretty good job.
>> [LAUGH]
>> Here's another related and,
and, I think a fun one.
What is the project you're
working on right now or
recently finished about
which you're most excited?
>> Well, I mentioned Folksource before
which is the mobile crowdsourcing system,
and I tell you,I'm really excited
about that for, for the reason that.
I think it let's us explore
really interesting technical and
socio technical questions.
But I also think it let's
us have the potential to
do something that matters socially.
>> I mean our original vision for
this is that organizations that do,
largely that do good things in
the community whether non-profits or
local government groups that are trying
to make our local communities better.
Whether by improving
the physical infrastructure,
you know making sure that there
aren't pot-holes, litter and so on.
Or making sure public transit
works better, that we have.
You know, the stations where we need them,
making sure that our parks
serve the needs of people.
All of these things required data,
they required data,
about things in the physical world,
you know.
Where do people park their bikes?
Where do people litter?
Where are there too long waits for
the buses?
And.
A, an infrastructure, technological
infrastructure, that can let people,
ordinary citizens who care about this,
very easily give little bits of data
that can help the decision makers,
the organizations, understand what
needs to be done and do it better.
I think that's great.
Another aspect of that, it can help
engage everyday people, citizens, more
with their communities and feel like their
input is being heard, and it matters.
And so I'm really excited about that.
>> That is one that excites me as well.
I'm looking forward to
seeing what happens.
Well, thank you Loren for your time,
I'm sure all of our students very much
appreciated your insight and thoughts.
>> Thank you.
It's been fun talking with you, Brent.
