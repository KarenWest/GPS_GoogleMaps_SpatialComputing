Hey folks.
Welcome back to the Cartography module.
In this video, we're going to discuss
the highest level distinction in maps.
And, that is between thematic maps and
reference maps.
And, when you're making a reference map,
the set of design decisions and options
for those decisions, is quite different
than when you're making a thematic map.
So, being familiar with this distinction
is obviously quite important.
Now, to understand the difference
between reference maps and
thematic maps,
let's first take a step back.
And examine the types of maps that
we typically encounter these days,
as well as those that people
typically encountered in the past.
Not only will, will this help
us ground our discussion here in
this video about thematic and
reference maps.
It's also going to set the stage nicely
for the rest of the videos in this module.
On a day to day basis, for most of us,
the maps we're most likely to
encounter are online maps
using our desktop browsers.
And mobile maps using our smart phones.
Now on the online maps side,
of course Google Maps is the 800 pound
gorilla, but there are of course others.
And I wanted to call
them out specifically,
because I didn't have a chance
to in the last video.
There's MapQuest which
is still quite active.
We talked about that in module five,
I believe.
Bing Maps.
You've seen some screen shots from
Bing Maps throughout this MOOC.
And then of course OpenStreetMap
which we've spent a lot of time with.
On the mobile side, we've, we have of
course got the Google Maps app and
the controversial Apple Maps app.
A Windows phone has the Nokia HERE Map.
There's also Waze and
these types of things.
And as we saw in the last video,
the most recent data suggests that
Google has a comfortable lead in map apps,
a market share.
Although Apple isn't all that far behind.
Now personally,
I think I use these apps and
websites an average around,
of around one to two times per day.
Although my use goes way up when
I'm travelling in a new area.
And I suspect you're somewhere
around that usage level as well.
Now another type of map
I frequently encounter,
although significantly less often, is maps
that appear in news outlets that support,
augment and complement news articles.
So for instance, here you can see
that in the American southeast.
The income inequality is more serious and
it's more difficult for
someone who is poor to, as we say in the
United States, climb the income ladder.
Whereas up here in the great plains and
to a certain extent in
the Rocky Mountain region here,
it's, it's more easy to do so.
Although, still somewhat difficult.
Okay.
This map from the Washington Post
is another wonderful example of
a contextually relevant and very
interesting compliment to news coverage.
In this case about people who
are going to Syria to fight in
the various militias there.
Including, including the Islamic State.
This is a great example of
what's called a flow map.
Even more local news organizations
are in the mapping business.
So for instance,
here's a map that recently appeared in
the Twin Cities' Minneapolis and St.
Paul's primary newspaper here,
The Star Tribune.
This shows the best places to be
a transit commuter in the Twin Cities.
And as you can see, right around here,
where the U is, the university is.
The university is a great place
to work if you're someone who
likes to ride public transport.
Now we're coming up on the 2014
election here in the United States.
And around election time,
another map genre, the election
map enters many people's lives.
And it generally does so
in a very serious way.
So, I'm sure many of you are familiar with
the election maps like this one here.
This shows the elections of the,
this shows, excuse me,
the results of the 2012, election
between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.
Of course, election maps are not only
popular, popular in the United States.
Here's one from the recent
German Federal elections.
It's just showing Berlin.
And then here is one from
the recent Indian elections.
Which was something of a landslide,
as you can see from this map.
Of course, beyond news maps and
election maps, there are other types
of maps we encounter online as well.
For instance, I look at this
map here at least once a week.
It tells me which American football games
are going to be shown in Minneapolis on
the upcoming Sunday.
I'm always crossing my fingers
that the San Francisco 49ers,
my home team, are going to be on TV.
But even with the dominance of this, these
types of online maps, of election maps,
of news maps.
And of course of Google maps, and
other online and mobile maps,.
Most of us also frequently
encounter offline maps, and
actually probably on a daily basis.
So for instance, for
those of you who work in a downtown or
on a corporate or university campus.
Or who ride public transportation, or
who go to malls regularly, and so on, and
so forth.
Those of us who do these types of
things are very familiar probably with
the publicly displayed local maps.
Of course, those of us who can
remember maps before the Internet,
know that there were also a, a large
number of other types of paper based maps.
For instance, I know in my family,
road atlases,
like this Rand McNally Road Atlas
were quite popular.
And world atlases like this, an Atlas
of the World by National Geographic,
was also something that my brothers and
I spent a good amount of time looking at.
Now going back further in time, I'm sure
some of you are probably familiar with
this map here by Charles Joseph Minard.
It was created in 1861, and it shows
the Napoleon's campaign on Russia in 1812.
It's a very famous map.
You can see here, this line here
represents the size of Napoleon's army,
and so does this line.
As he goes towards Russia,
the army gets smaller, and
smaller, and smaller, and smaller.
And I'm not going to get into
the history of this particular campaign.
But weather and some scorch earth
approaches by the Russians,
made this campaign very unsuccessful.
And you can see this by the time that
Napoleon's Army gets all the way
back to where it started,
the army’s size is a fraction of
what it was when it started out.
It’s a very famous map, early map.
You can also see that the temperature at
the time that the army was progressing was
also displayed here.
Now going back even further,
we have this map here,
which we saw in the last lecture.
It significantly predates even
paper as it's 14,000 years old.
It was found on a stone tablet
in a cave in Northern Spain.
It depicts you know,
various things in the local area.
So, a mountain, a river,
a pass, these types of things.
Okay.
So, that was a lot of maps.
I hope you enjoyed that,
going through them.
I know I enjoyed putting
those maps together.
But let's go ahead and
pop back up and return to our
primary learning objective here.
Which is the distinction between
reference maps and thematic maps.
Now of the maps we just saw,
these here are reference maps.
And these here are thematic maps.
Now why is this the case?
Well, let's look at these two
groups of maps in more detail.
Now, on the left hand side of this slide,
right?
We see maps that are primarily
about communicating the location of
specific entities.
And often how to navigate
to these entities as well.
So another way to put this,
is that the main use cases,
the main reason why people use reference
maps are navigation, and orientation.
We use reference maps to orient
ourselves in our surroundings.
As well to figure out and
orient where things are in
the context of their surroundings.
And of these maps,
as a result of their primary use cases
being navigation and orientation.
We frequently find ourselves asking, and
in fact, we typically almost always find
ourselves asking questions like,
where is this place I'm looking for?
Where am I relative to this place?
Where is this place
relative to things I know?
How do I get to this place,
and so on and so forth.
Now this is true of the latest and
greatest version of Google Maps.
And it's also true of publicly
displayed local maps we encounter
in our environment.
And interestingly, and this makes sense
because all of these are reference maps.
It's also true of what the folks were
using this map on this stone tablet 14,000
years ago in Spain.
Right?
All of these have very similar use cases.
They're all reference maps.
Thematic maps on the other hand,
aid in a fundamentally different
geocommunication purpose.
Rather than being intended to communicate
the locations of specific entities.
Thematic maps are,
in the words of the well known Thematic
Cartography Textbook by Dr. Terry Slocum
the University of Minnesota's very own Dr.
McMaster, and their colleagues.
Thematic maps are used to emphasize
the spatial distribution,
spatial distribution, key word.
Of one or more geographic attributes.
You don't use thematic maps,
like those I put on this slide to help
readers find the nearest pizza parlor.
Or to help them figure out where they
are in the context of their surroundings.
You, you use these thematic maps,
like those on the slide, to help readers
understand the spacial distributions
of things like, for instance.
The size of an army, where an army comes
from, which football game is on TV, and
of course election results.
So, to summarize,
reference maps are used to communicate
the location of specific entities.
For instance, pizza parlors, mountains
in Spain 14,000 years ago, and so
on and so forth.
And of course, reference maps are also
used to communicate how to get to
these places.
Whereas thematic maps are used to
communicate the spatial distribution of
one or more geographic attributes.
Now, because of the fundamentally
different geocommunication functions of
reference and thematic maps.
Understanding whether you need
to create a reference map or
a thematic map, is one of the first things
you need to do in the map-making process.
So for instance, if,
if the number one thing I
am trying to communicate is
the location of specific entities,
I'm going to want to be
thinking about a reference map.
On the other hand,
if I'm trying to communicate the spatial
distribution of a geographic attribute.
Say for instance, what football games
are playing in which places, or
election results,
I'm going to want to make a thematic map.
Now, on a much more basic level, knowing
the difference between reference and
thematic maps, is a key early step
towards being an educated map reader.
And a member of the broader
cartography community.
And speaking of which,
I want to circle back to something
I foreshadowed in the first video.
About the dramatic impact of
the transition from paper to
digital media in cartography.
In his web cartography text book,
referring to the rise of web
cartography in the past 20 years.
Dr. Muehlenhaus writes, the last time
cartography went through such a sea change
was with the advent of thematic mapping.
Which occurred in earnest in the 19th
century with maps like Minard's map of
Napoleon's 1812 Campaign on Russia.
So now that you understand
the difference between thematic and
reference maps, you can really understand
the strength of this statement.
He's saying that now,
there's now a third big transition.
We went from reference maps,
added thematic maps, and now we have this
third thing which is web cartography.
So, I do want to clarify
one common point of
confusion when distinguishing thematic and
reference maps.
And that is well,
I'm looking at search results here for
Korean barbecue in Chicago.
[INAUDIBLE] showing just
a spacial distribution of
Korean barbecue restaurants.
But you said that Google Maps
is a reference map.
Well, it comes down to the emphasis of
what your map is trying to do, right?
Google Maps is not trying to show
me what parts of the city have more
Korean barbecue, although,
certainly I can tell that.
The main goal of Google Maps
is to help me navigate to.
And figure out where these
Korean restaurants are, so
that I can get my lovely.
And my personal favorite is a,
a Korean burrito which they
do quite well in, in Chicago.
Okay.
In the following two videos,
we're going to individually focus on
reference maps first,
and then thematic maps.
And then lastly of course, we are going
to do a brief video on spatialization.
And that is it for this video.
I'll see you in the next video,
where we'll talk about reference maps.
